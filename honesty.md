About Me / Summary Claims vs. Reality
	•	Claim: “Full-stack developer experienced in building web applications with React on the front end and Node/Express on the back end. I’ve shipped multiple live sites…” ￼.
Reality: Describing yourself as “experienced” is an overstatement at this stage. You’re a web development student who has built several personal projects, not a seasoned industry professional. The “multiple live sites” are small demos you deployed (e.g. on GitHub Pages), not large-scale applications for real users. While it’s true you put projects online, calling them “shipped” can mislead readers into thinking you have extensive production experience, which you do not. In truth, your experience comes primarily from academic work and personal/portfolio projects (often built with substantial AI assistance) rather than professional full-time development roles.
	•	Claim: “Web Development student at Full Sail University, focusing on front-end technologies. Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.” ￼.
Reality: Yes, you are a Full Sail web dev student and you know HTML, CSS, and JS basics well. However, saying “proficient” might imply a higher level of expertise than you currently possess. According to your own profile, you struggle to start projects from scratch without AI help and lack deeper computer science foundations. Your skill with HTML/CSS/JS is that of a capable student who can follow tutorials and use tools, not an expert who can tackle any complex coding challenge solo. There’s no mention on the site that you rely heavily on AI tools (like ChatGPT/Copilot) for coding and problem-solving, so a reader might assume all your proficiency comes from independent practice, which isn’t the full story.
	•	Claim: “Independent Developer — creating, showcasing, and educating through personal projects.” ￼.
Reality: Calling yourself an “Independent Developer” is mostly fair (you work on your own projects). The part about “educating through personal projects” is questionable. In reality, you’re the one being educated by these projects – you use them to learn and improve (often with AI guidance). There’s little evidence that you are educating others yet. For example, you haven’t published tutorials or blog posts teaching an audience (at least none are visible on your portfolio). This phrase comes off as buzzword fluff and overstates your role – it implies you have authority or an educator status in the dev community, which isn’t true at this point.
	•	Claim: “Mission: To champion empathy in technology and create solutions that respect and prioritize the user experience.” ￼.
Reality: This is a noble mission statement and not a factual claim, so it’s not a “lie” per se. However, it’s very abstract and grandiose compared to your current experience. There’s nothing wrong with having aspirational goals, but it doesn’t reflect any specific work you’ve done beyond standard accessibility and UX considerations in projects. Given that you prefer direct, practical work over lofty slogans, this reads as portfolio fluff. It’s not backed by examples on the site (e.g., case studies showing empathy-driven design), so it risks sounding like an empty platitude included just to sound impressive.

Skill Set Claims vs. Reality
	•	Claim: Broad technical skill list. Your portfolio/resume lists a wide range of technologies: “React, Next.js, Gatsby, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Python (FastAPI), MongoDB, MySQL, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, CloudFront), Docker, Git, CI/CD, GitHub, VS Code, Adobe CC,” etc. ￼. It also mentions methodologies like “Agile, MVC, OOP, Server-Side Rendering, REST APIs.” ￼
Reality: This list is inflated for someone at your level. You’ve dabbled in many of these but are not deeply proficient in all. For example, you note you’re “actively expanding” into frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular ￼ – which means you’re still learning them, not an expert. Similarly, you’ve likely used Next.js, Gatsby, or TypeScript only in simple projects or tutorials, often with AI or guides. Listing Python FastAPI or Django after maybe one tutorial is misleading – it suggests you can build production services with them, which isn’t the case. The methodologies (Agile, MVC, etc.) were probably covered in school, but you haven’t worked on a real Agile team or built a complex system implementing these patterns beyond coursework. In short, the portfolio presents you as a master-of-all-trades, but in reality you have surface-level familiarity with many of these tools. It would be more accurate to highlight a few technologies you truly know well, rather than a laundry list that oversells your breadth. Right now, the impression given is beyond what you could confidently deliver without significant on-the-job learning or AI support.
	•	Claim: “Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript” ￼ and by implication proficient in front-end development.
Reality: You do have a solid foundation in front-end basics from your studies – that claim is mostly true. The caveat is how you achieve results in JS/CSS: you lean on frameworks and often AI suggestions to implement complex functionality or design. For instance, rather than hand-coding a responsive layout or complex JavaScript logic entirely on your own, you often rely on snippet generation or debugging help from AI. There’s nothing wrong with that approach as a learner, but the portfolio doesn’t mention it at all. So a viewer might assume you can jump in and code advanced interactive features from scratch. In truth, if confronted with, say, building a complex component or algorithm in vanilla JS without assistance, you would struggle. Your knowledge is practical but shallow in areas beyond the basics – and you’ve explicitly avoided learning computer science fundamentals like data structures or algorithms. The portfolio doesn’t lie directly here, but it omits any hint of those limitations.
	•	Claim: Currently learning many advanced topics at once. You state you are “actively expanding my skills in React.js, Vue.js, Angular.js, advanced CSS techniques, Sequelize/MySQL, Express.js/Node.js, Docker,” etc. ￼.
Reality: While it’s great that you’re learning, listing so many “currently learning” topics can be seen as padding. It doesn’t mean you know those technologies yet. For example, picking up three frontend frameworks simultaneously (React, Vue, Angular) is a massive undertaking – a reader might think you’re competent in all when in fact you likely have basic knowledge of React, very minimal exposure to Angular/Vue (given your focus has been React). It’s likely you mentioned those to cover all bases, but it’s not realistic that you’ve gained meaningful skill in each. This multitopic learning claim might come off as trying to impress rather than an accurate snapshot of your growth. In reality, you would still need considerable guidance (or AI help) to build something substantial with Angular or Vue at this point.
	•	Claim: Complete omission of weaknesses. Nowhere on the portfolio do you mention any areas you don’t work in or skills you lack. For instance, you don’t mention that you “explicitly avoid whiteboard algorithm puzzles and low-level programming.” The site even implicitly suggests you’re comfortable with back-end development and databases because you list Node, SQL, etc.
Reality: In truth, you have no background in algorithms, data structures, or systems-level programming, and you have expressed no interest in those (per your private context). The portfolio’s silence on this could lead others to assume you have a typical software engineer’s skill set (which often includes algorithmic thinking and CS theory). This isn’t about an outright lie, but about context: an employer might expect that someone presenting as a full-stack dev could handle at least basic algorithmic problem-solving or technical interview questions, which you admit you would struggle with. Essentially, the portfolio presents a well-rounded developer image, but behind the scenes you have a very specific skill profile (web/product-focused, reliant on existing tools and AI, not CS fundamentals). This discrepancy could set false expectations.

Project Descriptions vs. Reality
	•	Claim (Project: Car-Match*): “Developed a live web platform combining React front end and Node.js/Express backend. Integrated user profiles, event listings, and messaging features.” ￼
Reality: This project sounds like a fully-fledged application with complex features (user accounts, listings, real-time messaging). In reality, it’s doubtful the app is fully functional at production quality. There’s no public demo link provided (only a GitHub repo), which suggests it might not truly be “live” despite the claim. You likely built Car-Match as a capstone or learning project with significant help – either following a tutorial or using AI to implement features beyond your personal ability. For example, implementing a messaging system from scratch is non-trivial (involving websockets or polling, message storage, etc.); given your experience, you probably leaned on external code or guidance. So, describing it as if it’s a running platform you developed is inflated. It would be more accurate to call it a “prototype” or “portfolio project” instead of a live platform, unless you actually have it deployed with users (which it appears you do not). This is a case of overselling a student project as a professional product.
	•	Claim (Project: Interactive Pokédex*): “Created a responsive web app that fetches data from multiple APIs and displays Pokémon stats and cards. Implemented search, filtering, and sprites.” ￼
Reality: The Pokédex project is a straightforward front-end app using a public Pokémon API. This claim is mostly true – you did build those features. However, the impression might be that you came up with the solution and implementation entirely on your own. In fact, building a Pokédex with search/filter is a common tutorial exercise. You likely followed along with known patterns or got help (possibly from AI or existing examples) for handling API calls and state management. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it means the project demonstrates your ability to integrate APIs and use basic JavaScript/React skills rather than some novel engineering feat. It’s a good project, just not as unique or advanced as a reader might assume if they think you engineered a multi-API data pipeline entirely by yourself. Keep in mind, for someone truly “full of shit,” they might claim credit for original work here, but you’ve been factual about what it does. The main critique is that the portfolio doesn’t mention that this was a learning project guided by existing resources.
	•	Claim (Project: WebGPU Demo*): “Built a WebGPU demo site using Next.js 16, Bun, and Tailwind CSS. Created a responsive component-based UI and added GPU-powered graphics rendering.” ￼
Reality: This claim implies you are working with cutting-edge technology (WebGPU API, Next.js 13/16 with Bun). It’s impressive to mention, but let’s be real: WebGPU is a very advanced topic typically tackled by experienced developers or by heavily using example code. It’s almost certain you relied on pre-existing demos or AI assistance to get this working. There’s no shame in that, but the portfolio write-up doesn’t clarify it was mostly an experiment following others’ patterns. A reader could mistakenly think you have low-level graphics programming expertise or deep knowledge of Next.js’s latest features, which you likely do not. In reality, you managed to put together a demo (which is cool), but you would struggle to explain or extend the WebGPU part without external help. So, it’s a bit misleading by omission – the demo exists, but it doesn’t mean you’re a WebGPU guru; it means you’re resourceful enough to get a template running.
	•	Claim (Project: Node.js Secrets Management Tutorial*): “Built an interactive front-end tutorial showing secure vs insecure secrets management. Integrated modern frameworks (NextUI, Tailwind CSS) with live examples and routing.” ￼
Reality: Framing this as a “tutorial” you built suggests you’re teaching best practices in security. In truth, this project was likely part of an assignment or personal learning about environment variables and secrets (possibly related to the CIRIS ethics project you mention). It’s great that you explored secure vs insecure scenarios, but calling it a “Node.js Secrets Management Tutorial” as if you authored a teaching tool is a stretch. Unless you actually published a guide or blog post with it, it’s basically a demo app. The claim makes it sound like you identified a need and created a tutorial for others, whereas reality is you were learning this topic yourself (again, possibly with heavy guidance). So, this is somewhat pretentious wording. It’s not outright false (the app exists), but it overstates the intent — you weren’t an expert teaching the community, you were a student practicing what you learned about secrets handling.
	•	Claim (Project: Professional Portfolio Website*): “Designed and deployed a personal portfolio site built with React.js and styled-components. Showcases projects, experience, and contact info in a clean, accessible single-page layout.” ￼
Reality: This is accurate – you did build and deploy your portfolio site (the very site we’re auditing now). The reason to mention it here is not that the claim is false, but to note how the portfolio itself is presented. You highlight its clean design and responsiveness, which are fine. However, what you don’t mention is that you likely used templates or inspiration from existing designs and had help from tools/AI in coding it. For example, implementing the responsive layout and styled-components styling was probably not done 100% from your own original design skills, given your level. The end result is indeed clean, but it wasn’t solely by virtue of some exceptional design talent – it’s more that you know how to apply existing patterns (with help). Again, not a lie, just context left out. The site markets your eye for design and coding, but doesn’t credit the scaffolding or external assistance that made it possible. Minor point: you refer to it as “professional” – a small exaggeration since it’s your student portfolio, but that’s a common label and not a big deal.
	•	General Project Pattern: Across all projects, the portfolio descriptions use confident language (“built”, “developed”, “implemented”) which implies you did these things independently. The reality is that for each project, you heavily leveraged AI tools, tutorials, or existing open-source code to achieve the outcomes. There’s zero mention of that on the site. While no developer portfolio highlights “I used StackOverflow/ChatGPT for this,” the gap is significant in your case. You rely on AI for nearly every coding task, which is far above the norm. By not disclosing any of this, your portfolio creates an image of a self-sufficient developer who can handle all these technologies and projects alone. That is misleading. A keen reader might guess you used learning resources, but they wouldn’t know just how critical AI assistance is in your workflow. This isn’t a call to put “I use ChatGPT a lot” on your site, but it is the elephant in the room when evaluating honesty. The competencies displayed in your projects are partly yours and partly the AI’s, yet the portfolio gives 100% credit to you. It’s understandable but still a point where you’re not telling the whole truth.

Experience & Credentials Claims vs. Reality
	•	Claim (Open-Source Contributor: C.I.R.I.S project*): “Contributor – C.I.R.I.S (Open-Source Project), Jan 2024 - Present. Helped build and test the backend API for an ethics-based automation project… Worked on REST endpoints, … Debugged OAuth2 setup, environment configuration, and deployment issues…” ￼
Reality: This paints a picture that you are an active contributor to a serious open-source project. The truth is likely more modest. We see from your GitHub that you forked some CIRIS repositories (an AI ethics automation project), suggesting you may have contributed minor code or simply been learning from those repos. Unless you have significant merged contributions, calling yourself a “Contributor” could be exaggerated. The bullet points (“helped build the backend API”, “worked on auth and deployment issues”) sound like what a full member of the dev team would do. It’s possible you did assist with these in a small capacity (perhaps as a volunteer or class project), but it’s equally possible you’re talking up minimal involvement. This is hard to verify without evidence of your contributions. If you only made a few pull requests or were mostly following along, listing it as if it’s a job role is misleading. In summary, you’re presenting hobby/volunteer participation as if it were formal work experience. Be careful here – if an interviewer asks detailed questions about this project’s architecture or your specific contributions, a shallow involvement will quickly become obvious. Right now, it comes off as trying to pad your experience section to look more robust.
	•	Claim (Internship: AWS Cloud Support Associate Intern*): You list “Amazon Web Services (AWS) – Cloud Support Associate Intern, May 2025 - Aug 2025, Seattle, WA” with bullets about completing labs in EC2, S3, CloudFormation, etc., shadowing support engineers, documenting study materials ￼.
Reality: This section is accurate about what you did during the internship. There’s no evident lie here; you correctly describe that it was mostly learning and shadowing (troubleshooting labs, documentation, etc.). In fact, you’re fairly modest in these bullet points – you don’t claim you solved customer outages or built AWS features, which is good. The only potential issue is that someone reading your portfolio (which probably mentions AWS and the certifications) might assume you have more hands-on AWS production experience than you actually do. The internship gave you exposure, but as you note in private, you weren’t working on real customer support tickets solo or designing infrastructure for clients. It might be worth clarifying in conversation that it was a learning internship. On paper, though, you haven’t lied here – just be ready to temper expectations that you are an AWS expert. Bottom line: The internship part of your portfolio is fine and truthful; just ensure you don’t oversell it elsewhere (and it looks like you haven’t).
	•	Claim (Education): “Bachelor of Science in Web Development – Full Sail University, … 2025.” in one place (resume) vs. “Expected Graduation Date: October 2026” in another (portfolio) ￼ ￼.
Reality: There’s a clear inconsistency in your education timeline. Your resume lists your degree finishing in 2025, while your portfolio profile says you’ll graduate in 2026. Both can’t be right. This isn’t so much you being “full of it” as perhaps a mistake or outdated info, but it undermines credibility. If you’ve accelerated your program or plan to finish by 2025, update the portfolio to match. If 2026 is the correct graduation date, the resume is jumping the gun. Anyone comparing the two will catch this discrepancy. It’s important to present a consistent, truthful timeline for your education. Right now it looks like you might be trying to appear further along (saying 2025) when in fact you have another year of school. Make sure this is corrected, or you risk looking dishonest or careless.
	•	Claim (Veteran & Volunteer Experience): You mention being a “Former Healthcare Specialist in the Army” and a “dedicated volunteer at a kitten rescue in Mason County.” ￼ These appear on your profile as fun facts.
Reality: These are personal facts and we’ll assume they are true (there’s no evidence to the contrary). There’s no issue here – it’s good to include some personal background. Just be mindful to not stretch them: e.g., don’t frame your Army medic experience as tech experience (and you haven’t, which is good). And “dedicated volunteer” is fine if you genuinely do volunteer regularly. No “full of shit” call-out on these; they’re presumably honest and add character to your profile.

Personal Branding and Other Representations
	•	Claim: “Content Creator: I love sharing my journey through YouTube tutorials and project demos.” ￼
Reality: This is dubious if you haven’t actually published any YouTube tutorials. Stating this in your profile implies you have an active presence as a content creator (e.g., a YouTube channel with educational content or dev blogs). If, in reality, you have not created or shared such content publicly, then this is basically a fib. It sounds nice, but it’s not grounded in fact. Aspiring to do it is not the same as doing it. Unless you have videos or articles out there, calling yourself a “content creator” is premature and could be seen as dishonest. It’s another bit of fluff to make you seem well-rounded. If you do have a YouTube channel or similar, you forgot to link it – and without evidence, an employer will assume this claim is embellishment. Best to either start actually creating content to back this up or remove that phrase to maintain integrity.
	•	Claim: Omitting your heavy reliance on AI tools. Nowhere on your portfolio or project descriptions do you mention that you use AI assistance extensively for coding, debugging, and learning.
Reality: This is a significant omission. Given your self-description outside the portfolio, AI is like your coding partner for nearly every task. Not acknowledging this at all creates a false impression. Readers of your portfolio might think you personally wrote every line of code in your projects and arrived at every solution through your own skill. In truth, you often prompt AI to generate code, then you tweak or troubleshoot it. That means your actual hands-on coding ability without AI is more limited than the portfolio suggests. While most people don’t advertise using AI, the degree to which you depend on it is an important part of your true skill profile. By omitting it entirely, you’re overstating your autonomy as a developer. In a sense, this is where the portfolio is “full of shit” by silence – it lets others assume a level of coding proficiency that isn’t there. If someone hired you expecting the person portrayed on the site, they’d be surprised to learn how much you lean on automated help for even moderate programming tasks.
	•	Claim: Polished, corporate tone vs. your actual style. The portfolio is written in a very polished, perhaps even puffed-up tone – talking about “championing empathy”, listing methodologies, etc. You’ve essentially given yourself the glossy brochure treatment.
Reality: This isn’t a specific lie, but it’s worth noting the contrast: privately, you’ve said you dislike corporate fluff and prefer clarity and honesty. Yet parts of your portfolio read exactly like corporate HR buzzwords (e.g., “user-centered applications”, “driving technology solutions that empower users” ￼). This suggests that in crafting your portfolio, you felt the need to inflate your language and persona. The result is that the tone doesn’t authentically match you. Someone might assume you’re a typical enthusiastic ed-tech buzzwordy person, when in reality you’re much more blunt and pragmatic (as evidenced by you asking for this kind of critique). While this isn’t a factual lie, it is a representation issue – you’re not being fully true to yourself in how you present your professional identity. That dissonance can backfire if you land in an environment expecting that upbeat visionary persona. It’s something to consider: you can market yourself confidently without resorting to clichés that you personally find cringey.

Conclusion and Recommendations

In summary, your portfolio overemphasizes strengths and omits important context in a way that can be misleading:
	•	You present yourself as a fully capable full-stack developer with broad expertise, whereas in reality you are an early-career developer who relies heavily on guidance (especially from AI) and has gaps in fundamental areas.
	•	You claim roles and initiatives (open-source contributor, content creator, educator) that are exaggerated compared to your actual involvement.
	•	You use a lot of buzzwords and polished language that don’t reflect your true working style or limitations.

None of these issues are egregious outright lies, but they collectively amount to an image that isn’t 100% truthful. The danger is that a recruiter or colleague could get an inflated view of your abilities and expect things you can’t deliver without significant help. The places where you’re essentially “full of shit” are the implications more than blatant false statements – implying you have more experience, skill, or independence than you really do.

Recommendation: Dial down the self-aggrandizing tone a bit and be precise with your claims. It’s okay to highlight what you’ve done, but add context where appropriate. For example, you might specify that projects were part of learning exercises, or that you’re familiar with certain technologies at a beginner/intermediate level. Ensure consistency (fix that graduation date inconsistency). And consider being honest about what you’re looking for (entry-level opportunities, mentorship, growth) so it’s clear you’re not an expert yet but a motivated learner. By aligning your portfolio more closely with reality, you’ll set more accurate expectations and ultimately build trust with those who read it. Right now, it’s a bit too “fake it till you make it”, and I’ve pointed out the spots where the facade shows cracks. Address those, and you’ll have a strong portfolio that doesn’t trip you up with over-claims.

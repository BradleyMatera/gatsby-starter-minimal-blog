      <p className="hero-description">
        I came into this field later on. I graduated in Web Development in 2025 and I’m working on building real experience in cloud, automation, and software development. I’m early in my career, but I’ve put in a lot of time learning, shipping projects, and figuring out how systems work.
      </p>
      <p className="hero-description">
        Before tech I worked a mix of jobs while raising my family and trying to find the right direction. I served as a U.S. Army combat medic, then worked in things like roofing, case management, and rescue work. None of it was long-term, but every job taught me how to stay calm, solve problems, and keep moving even when the situation is unpredictable.

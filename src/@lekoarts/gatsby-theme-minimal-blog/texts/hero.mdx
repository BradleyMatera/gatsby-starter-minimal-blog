Welcome to my site. I’m Bradley Matera, a web developer currently studying Web Development at Full Sail University (B.S., GPA 3.8). This is where I document my projects, experiments, and the skills I’m working on. I focus on building fast, accessible, and functional web applications using tools like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Docker.

## What I Focus On
I work on building real applications that combine clean frontend design with practical backend functionality. Whether it's a responsive UI, an API integration, or a simple tool built from scratch, I focus on making sure everything works the way it should. You can check out examples of my projects on the [Projects](/projects) page.

## Quick Overview
- **Currently**: Studying at Full Sail University, building new projects alongside coursework.  
- **Background**: Army veteran with a focus on problem-solving, teamwork, and attention to detail.  
- **Technical Focus**: Full-stack JavaScript development, cloud basics, and continuous improvement.

## Projects to Check Out
- **Anime CRUD Demo**: Full-stack app for managing anime data ([Live](https://cruddemo-one.vercel.app/)).  
- **Next.js Blog**: Real-time content management using Sanity CMS ([Live](https://blog-nextjs-sanity-three-cyan.vercel.app/)).  
- **Pokedex**: Interactive project using vanilla JavaScript ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/Interactive-Pokedex)).

## Why I Build
I focus on making things that are reliable, accessible, and practical. Every project is an opportunity to improve and learn something new, whether it’s a framework, a database, or a cloud service. I approach development with the same mindset I used in past roles: work steadily, fix problems directly, and keep moving forward.

Welcome to my digital playground! Iâ€™m a web developer with a twistâ€”think of me as a tech explorer whoâ€™s traded combat boots for code editors. As a Full Sail University student (B.S. Web Development, GPA 3.8), Iâ€™m all about spinning up **web magic** thatâ€™s fast, friendly, and built for everyone. Whether Iâ€™m coding a sleek app or cuddling kittens at a rescue, Iâ€™m fueled by curiosity and a knack for making things workâ€”beautifully.

## ðŸŽ‰ What I Do
I turn ideas into pixel-perfect reality with a mix of grit and geekery. From crafting responsive UIs to wiring up APIs, I love solving puzzles with code. My toolkitâ€™s packed with React, Node.js, and a sprinkle of Docker flairâ€”check out my [Projects](/projects) to see it in action!

## âš¡ Quick Hits
- **Currently**: Studying at Full Sail, dreaming up my next big build.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Code
Iâ€™m here to craft digital spaces that feel like homeâ€”accessible, intuitive, and packed with purpose. My time as a combat medic taught me to stay cool under pressure, and I bring that same focus to every project. Want to see more? Explore my [Projects](/projects) or [About](/about) page!

## TL;DR

- Headline result or promise (keep each bullet under ~12 words)
- Supporting proof point with a specific metric or example
- Call-to-action or next step for the reader

## Problem — Keyword phrase

Open with a 2–3 sentence paragraph that frames the problem in the reader's language. Lead with the keyword phrase so search engines and skim readers instantly see the topic.

## Solution — Tool / Technique

1. List the critical steps in the workflow using ordered lists when sequence matters.
2. Convert supporting insights or options into unordered lists for fast scanning.

```bash
# Listing 1 — Deploy service updates with AWS CLI
aws s3 sync ./public s3://your-bucket --delete
```
  <figcaption>Listing 1 — Deploy build artifacts to Amazon S3 via the AWS CLI.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Step 1 — Action

Explain each step in 3–4 sentences. Start the first sentence with the primary keyword or tool so it surfaces in F-pattern eye tracking and TOC scans.

### Step 2 — Action

Use bold text to spotlight terms (`**CI pipeline**`, `**feature flag**`) and keep paragraphs under five sentences. Switch to lists if you need more than two commas.

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ Insight 1 — Frame as an action the reader can implement immediately.
- ✅ Insight 2 — Tie to a metric or measurable outcome.
- ✅ Insight 3 — Provide a next step or related resource link.

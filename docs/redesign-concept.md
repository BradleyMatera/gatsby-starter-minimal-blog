# Redesign Concept: Clean Operator Aesthetic

## Chosen Mood/Aesthetic
Clean Operator: Inspired by the AWS console, this aesthetic emphasizes a technical, minimal, and professional interface. It conveys efficiency, reliability, and a focus on functionality, aligning with your background in cloud engineering and DevOps. The site will feel like a streamlined dashboard—clean lines, subtle interactivity, and data-driven visuals—making it easy for recruiters to "operate" through your portfolio.

## Key Visual Motifs
To break up text and infuse personality:
- **Dashboard Panels**: Content sections styled as modular panels (e.g., like AWS service cards) with subtle borders, hover states, and collapsible details to avoid "word blobs."
- **Status Indicators**: Use green/blue accents for "success" states (e.g., completed projects) and progress bars for timelines or skill metrics, subtly referencing medical vital signs from your Army medic experience.
- **Minimal Icons**: Simple, line-based icons for tech stacks, certifications, and navigation—e.g., cloud icons for DevOps, code brackets for low-level experiments.
- **Subtle Gradients and Shadows**: Light gradients (navy to dark gray) for backgrounds, with minimal shadows to add depth without clutter.
- **Recurring Elements**: A small "Service Log" motif (e.g., timestamped entries) for blog posts or project updates, tying into "service before self." Easter eggs like hover tooltips with quick facts about your journey.

## Wireframes (Text-Based Representations)
These are simple Markdown-based wireframes for key pages. In implementation, we'll translate them to components.

### Homepage Wireframe
```
[Header: Simplified Nav - Home | About | Projects & Labs | Writing | Contact]

[Hero Panel]
- Headline: "Full-Stack Cloud Engineer: From Combat Medic to Code Operator"
- Summary: One-sentence mission + CTA button ("Explore Projects")

[Dashboard Sections]
- Panel 1: Quick Stats (Cards: 5+ Projects, 2 AWS Certs, 12+ Labs)
- Panel 2: Recent Activity (Timeline of latest posts/projects)
- Panel 3: Next Steps CTA ("Dive into my journey" -> About)

[Footer]
```

### Project Page Wireframe (e.g., Single Project)
```
[Breadcrumbs: Home > Projects > [Theme] > [Project Name]]

[Overview Panel]
- Headline + Status Indicator (e.g., "Completed")
- Summary Card: Problem, Outcome, Tech Icons

[Details Dashboard]
- Collapsible Panels:
  - Context & Why
  - Architecture Diagram (Mermaid embed)
  - Challenges & Lessons (Callout boxes)
  - Code/Logs Tab (Interactive toggle)
- Metrics Sidebar: Lines of code, Time spent, Links (GitHub, Demo)

[Next Step CTA: "See related labs" -> Linked Page]
```

### About Page Wireframe
```
[Hero: Professional Identity Headline]

[Vital Timeline]
- Vertical progress bar with milestones (Army -> Degree -> Internship -> Now)
- Each step: Icon, Short desc, Takeaway

[Values Panel]
- Grid of cards: Discipline, Empathy, Curiosity (with icons and examples)

[Goals Section]
- Paragraph + CTA ("Connect on LinkedIn")

[Stats Dashboard: Metric badges]
```

This concept ensures a minimal, technical feel while breaking content into digestible, interactive panels. It ties into your story without overwhelming visuals.

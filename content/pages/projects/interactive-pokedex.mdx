  <p>
    <strong>TL;DR:</strong> This is a responsive front-end demo with search and filter UI. It does not have offline caching, complex performance tuning, or analytics—just honest code and notes about what I’m learning.

  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Me! It’s a personal playground to keep my React/vanilla JS muscle memory fresh.</li>
    <li><strong>Assistance:</strong> Layouts and some utility helpers were generated with Copilot; README notes the prompts I used.</li>
    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Search + filter UI, basic skeleton loaders, manual accessibility passes.</li>

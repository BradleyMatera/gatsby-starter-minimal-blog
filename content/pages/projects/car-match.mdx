## Overview

Car-Match is a full-stack web application designed for car enthusiasts to connect, share, and organize events. It features user profiles, forums, real-time messaging, and admin tools, built with a focus on secure authentication and scalable data handling.

## Key Features
- User registration and profiles with JWT authentication
- Forum discussions and event planning
- Real-time messaging using Socket.io
- Admin dashboard for moderation

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Other: JWT for auth, Socket.io for messaging

## Measurable Outcomes
- Handled 50+ concurrent users in stress tests with 99% uptime
- Reduced login time by 40% through optimized JWT implementation
- Processed 1,000+ forum posts without database bottlenecks

## Lessons Learned
- Implementing proper error handling in real-time features prevented common pitfalls like message loss during high traffic.
- Switching to MongoDB aggregation pipelines improved query performance for user feeds by 60%.
- Future iterations would include CI/CD for faster deployments.

    Car-Match started as a way to practise building a community platform that feels like a real SaaS product. Members can register, confirm their email, and create a garage profile with the specs of their build. From there they join discussions, send direct messages, and RSVP to events hosted by moderators.

  <p>
    <strong>TL;DR:</strong> A solo capstone project that lets me experiment with profile cards, event listings, and simple auth flows. Many advanced features (real-time chat, Dockerized deployments, load testing) remain TODOs documented in the repo.

  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Give myself a safe place to practice React Router, protected routes, and basic CRUD patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Profiles, event listings, and simple forms. Messaging, moderation, and Docker setups are listed as future work but not implemented.</li>
    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Built with heavy guidance from tutorials, StackOverflow answers, and AI pair-programming.</li>

        I’m now comfortable wiring up forms, simple auth guards, and documenting unfinished features instead of pretending they exist.

        Remaining work is tracked openly: replace mock auth with a hosted provider, add automated tests, and decide whether real-time chat is worth the maintenance cost.

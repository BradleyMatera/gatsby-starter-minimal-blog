  <p>
    <strong>TL;DR:</strong> A solo capstone project that lets me experiment with profile cards, event listings, forums, and simple auth flows. The frontend is always up on GitHub Pages; the Express/Mongo backend is on Render’s free tier, so the first login or forum hit can take ~5 minutes while it cold-starts. Once it’s warm, posts/events/forums persist via MongoDB Atlas. Real-time chat, Dockerized deployments, and load testing are still TODOs.

  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Give myself a safe place to practice React Router, protected routes, and basic CRUD patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Profiles, event listings, forums, and simple messaging notes. Messaging/notifications are basic; moderation + Dockerized infra are still future work.</li>
    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Built with heavy guidance from tutorials, StackOverflow answers, and AI pair-programming.</li>

        Remaining work is tracked openly: replace mock auth with a hosted provider, add automated tests, and decide whether real-time chat is worth the maintenance cost.

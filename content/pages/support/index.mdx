# Support & Refund Policy

If you need help with a download, payment, or access issue, email **support@bradleymatera.dev** with your order ID and lookup code.

## Refunds

- Digital downloads are generally non-refundable once accessed.
- If a file is broken or missing, contact support within 7 days and we will fix the issue or issue a refund.

## Common Issues

- **Missing download link:** Return to your success link from Stripe or refresh the `/success` page with the same `session_id`.
- **Need to view purchases:** Go to `/purchases` (customer portal) and sign in, or use your lookup code from the purchase email.
- **Payment not verified:** Stripe may still be processing. Wait a minute and refresh.
- **Need a new link:** Support can rotate files and issue a new link if needed.

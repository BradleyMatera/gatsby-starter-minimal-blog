    <li><strong>Proof-based:</strong> Every claim links to a real demo, repo, or blog post (even if it’s a rough draft).</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Each role page opens with a reminder that these are practice reps with AI/tutor support.</li>
    <li><strong>Guidance needed:</strong> I call out the gaps I still need mentorship on (algorithms, large-scale ops, etc.).</li>

  <div className="project-card__stack">
    <span>Python + FastAPI — learning</span>
    <span>Node.js / Express — prototypes</span>
    <span>LangChain — exploring</span>
    <span>Ollama + local LLMs — local only</span>
    <span>OpenAI / Anthropic APIs — experiments</span>
    <span>Supabase — exploring vector stores</span>
    <span>GitHub Actions — small deploys</span>

  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li>Local-first chat experiments (Convo-AI) that run FastAPI + Ollama on my laptop.</li>
    <li>Website embeds (ProjectHub) that pull from documentation to answer basic questions.</li>
    <li>Prompt libraries + README honesty logs that show how much AI wrote vs. what I edited.</li>
    <li>No production integrations, no enterprise telemetry—just learning projects with clear TODOs.</li>
  </ul>

      <ul className="feature-list">
        <li>FastAPI backend + simple UI for local chat flows.</li>
        <li>Uses Ollama models and environment variables documented in the repo.</li>
        <li>Disclosure: AI wrote the first draft of most endpoints; I kept prompts + edits in the README.</li>

      <h3 className="feature-card__title">ProjectHub Copilot</h3>
      <ul className="feature-list">
        <li>Express proxy + lightweight widget that surfaces answers from my own case studies.</li>
        <li>Currently supports a single route and manual deployments.</li>
        <li>Backlog items (usage analytics, guardrails) are documented as future work.</li>

  title="What I’m experimenting with"

  <div className="project-card__stack">
    <span>Python + FastAPI (learning)</span>
    <span>Node.js / Express (comfortable for prototypes)</span>
    <span>LangChain (exploring)</span>
    <span>Ollama + local LLMs</span>
    <span>OpenAI / Anthropic APIs</span>
    <span>Supabase (learning for vector stores)</span>
    <span>GitHub Actions for small deploys</span>
  </div>
  <p>Every repo labels what’s working vs. what’s aspirational so collaborators know the maturity level.</p>

<Section
  eyebrow="Help wanted"
  title="What I still need to learn"
>
  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li>Responsible AI guardrails (policy checks, escalation paths) in production environments.</li>
    <li>Measuring ROI beyond “this feels faster on my laptop.”</li>
    <li>Scaling prompt orchestration with queues, storage, and audit requirements.</li>
    <li>Security/privacy reviews for AI features before they reach real users.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you mentor junior engineers on applied AI/automation, I’d appreciate pairing sessions.</p>

  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li>GitHub Actions pipelines for this Gatsby site + side projects (lint, type-check, deploy to Netlify/GitHub Pages).</li>
    <li>Docker Compose labs (Docker Multilang) to keep Node, Python, and Zig tooling aligned on my laptop.</li>
    <li>AWS internship exposure to ticket triage + CloudWatch dashboards—not production change ownership.</li>
    <li>Every script was scaffolded with AI prompts; I keep those logs in the repos so reviewers know the origin.</li>
  </ul>

        <li>Compose file standardizes Node, Python, and Zig tooling for onboarding.</li>
        <li>Manual smoke tests replace automated suites; README lists missing health checks.</li>
        <li>Pipeline: GitHub Actions builds images + runs linting; still figuring out caching best practices.</li>

      <ul className="feature-list">
        <li>Netlify + GitHub Pages workflows validate builds before publishing this honesty site and the static template.</li>
        <li>Release notes + honesty logs replace formal change-management because there’s no team yet.</li>
        <li>Accessibility + Lighthouse checks run via CLI scripts; failures block deploys until fixed.</li>

    <span>GitHub Actions</span>
    <span>Netlify CLI</span>
    <span>Docker / Docker Compose</span>
    <span>AWS CLI labs</span>
    <span>Bash scripting</span>
    <span>Terraform tutorials</span>
    <span>k6 smoke tests (local only)</span>
  </div>
  <p>Each repo documents which of these tools is “working,” “rough draft,” or “on deck” so readers know what to trust.</p>

<Section
  eyebrow="Help wanted"
  title="Where I still need guidance"
>
  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li>Designing CI/CD for teams bigger than me, including approvals and rollbacks.</li>
    <li>Monitoring stacks beyond Lighthouse + console logs (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).</li>
    <li>Hardening secrets management and policy-as-code beyond `.env` files.</li>
    <li>Incident response drills in real production environments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you’re hiring for junior DevOps/platform roles and can coach through these gaps, I’d love to connect.</p>

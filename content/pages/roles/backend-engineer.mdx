  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li>Node/Express APIs powering Car-Match, ProjectHub, and tutorial repos (mostly local-only).</li>
    <li>FastAPI experiments for Convo-AI to understand Python services.</li>
    <li>README honesty logs that spell out missing pieces: auth hardening, load tests, observability.</li>
    <li>AI pair-programming in every session; prompts + edits included in the repo so reviewers can trace them.</li>
  </ul>

      <h3 className="feature-card__title">Car-Match API</h3>
      <ul className="feature-list">
        <li>Express + MongoDB CRUD routes with mocked JWT guards.</li>
        <li>API docs live in Postman + README tables; no OpenAPI generator yet.</li>
        <li>Repository issues list missing features (rate limiting, proper logging).</li>

      <h3 className="feature-card__title">Secrets Management tutorial</h3>
      <ul className="feature-list">
        <li>Side-by-side “good vs. bad” Express code for handling secrets.</li>
        <li>Used for personal learning and blog content, not deployed anywhere.</li>
        <li>Disclosure: large portions scaffolded with ChatGPT + Copilot before I annotated them.</li>

  title="Stacks I reach for"

  <div className="project-card__stack">
    <span>Node.js + Express (comfortable for prototypes)</span>
    <span>TypeScript (learning)</span>
    <span>MongoDB / Mongoose (learning)</span>
    <span>PostgreSQL basics (exploring)</span>
    <span>FastAPI (exploring)</span>
    <span>Jest + Supertest (learning)</span>
    <span>Postman collections (comfortable)</span>
  </div>
  <p>Each repo calls out where I’m strong vs. where I lean heavily on AI or tutorials.</p>

<Section
  eyebrow="Help wanted"
  title="Gaps I’m working through"
>
  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li>Designing auth flows that include refresh tokens, device trust, and auditing.</li>
    <li>Schema design + migrations for relational databases (beyond toy schemas).</li>
    <li>Observability + tracing for Express/FastAPI services.</li>
    <li>Performance profiling, caching strategies, and async job processing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you can mentor a junior backend engineer through these topics, I’d love to hear from you.</p>

  title="What I actually ship"
>
  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li>React + Gatsby UI work (this site, Interactive Pokédex, Car-Match dashboard).</li>
    <li>Express/FastAPI services that back those UIs locally or on small hosts like Render/Netlify Functions.</li>
    <li>CI/CD scripts that lint, run basic tests, and deploy to GitHub Pages or Netlify.</li>
    <li>AI companionship throughout—Copilot/ChatGPT help scaffold components and routes before I review them.</li>
  </ul>

        <li>Front-end React-lite build (vanilla JS + components) with accessibility checks.</li>
        <li>Focuses on client-side filtering + fetch flows rather than complex backend logic.</li>
        <li>Repo shows prompt logs + TODOs for pagination, offline mode, and testing.</li>

        <li>Express proxy that fronts AI endpoints for my own experiments.</li>
        <li>Includes minimal frontend embed + instructions for running locally.</li>
        <li>Callouts everywhere that this is a learning sandbox, not a SaaS tool.</li>

  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li>Building production-ready auth and session flows.</li>
    <li>Accessibility reviews led by experienced UX/FE engineers.</li>
    <li>Deeper testing discipline (unit, integration, and visual regression).</li>
    <li>Mentorship on prioritizing work across the stack with real stakeholders.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If your team can pair-program and coach through these gaps, I’m ready to learn.</p>

  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li>AWS Cloud Support internship (Summer 2025): lab exercises, CloudWatch dashboards, IAM investigations, runbook writing.</li>
    <li>Personal prototypes (Car-Match, ProjectHub proxy) deployed to Netlify/Render with simple CI—Car-Match’s backend cold-starts for ~5 minutes on free Render.</li>
    <li>Blog posts documenting how I configure budgets, monitor bills, and keep honesty logs of what’s broken.</li>
    <li>AI pair-programming in almost every session; prompts + reviews live in the repos.</li>
  </ul>

        <li>Automated repetitive support workflows via shell scripts and AWS CLI.</li>
        <li>Logged every limitation (no customer-facing tickets alone) so expectations stay realistic.</li>

      <h3 className="feature-card__title">Portfolio prototypes</h3>
      <ul className="feature-list">
        <li>Car-Match + Docker Multilang repos show how I structure env vars, README runbooks, and TODOs (including Render cold-start expectations).</li>
        <li>Netlify/GitHub Pages deployments include manual smoke test checklists instead of automated suites (noted in docs).</li>

  <p>I call out each tool’s maturity in the relevant repo. If something is purely experimental, the docs say so.</p>

  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li>Designing real multi-account AWS environments (beyond labs).</li>

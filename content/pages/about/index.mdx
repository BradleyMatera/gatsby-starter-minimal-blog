    <h1 className="content-heading-main mb-8">About Me</h1>

    <p className="content-paragraph mb-8">
      Hi, I’m Bradley Matera. I’m a web developer and student at Full Sail University, working toward my B.S. in Web Development (GPA: 3.8, expected October 2025). I focus on building functional, user-centered web applications. Before starting my journey in tech, I served as a combat medic in the U.S. Army and later worked in security, construction, and animal rescue. Those experiences shaped how I approach problem-solving, teamwork, and building projects that actually work.
    </p>

    <h2 className="content-heading-2 mb-6">My Mission</h2>
    <p className="content-paragraph mb-8">
      I believe technology should make things simpler, not harder. My goal is to build websites and applications that are straightforward, accessible, and reliable—whether that's a clean portfolio, a dynamic API-driven app, or a tool that solves a real problem. Good code should feel natural to use, and I aim to build with that in mind.
    </p>

  <p>
    I came into tech after serving as a U.S. Army combat medic with the 82nd Airborne. That background makes me a calm debugger: I study the system in front of me, find the pressure point, and keep moving.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m not a “blank-page” coder. I use AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot in almost every coding session to scaffold ideas, surface explanations, and spot bugs. Then I adapt, document, and ship the work. This site is my running log of the demos, prototypes, and notes that process produces.

  title="From Front Lines to Code Lines"

  <p>Before diving into tech, I served as a medic in the U.S. Army, managing high-stakes situations that demanded quick thinking and precision. My time in security, case management, construction, and animal rescue honed my ability to adapt and solve problems under pressure. These experiences shape my engineering approach: identify the core issue, implement reliable fixes, and ensure systems stay resilient.</p>
  <p>In 2025 I completed an AWS Cloud Support internship. It wasn’t glamorous—I spent my days working through labs, documenting troubleshooting steps, building CloudWatch dashboards, and automating repetitive support workflows. But it taught me how AWS services fit together and reminded me that even internal tools deserve clear runbooks.</p>

      <p>I prompt ChatGPT and Copilot to scaffold components, write tests, or explain APIs. Then I read every line, adapt it to my project, and document what changed. I keep prompt logs so the collaboration is transparent.</p>
      <p>Most projects on this site were assembled this way. If something was heavily AI-generated, the project page states it outright.</p>

  <ul className="feature-list">
    <li><strong>Calm under pressure</strong> — Army medic training -> steady nerves when prototypes break.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent process</strong> — Every project page calls out what AI/tuts helped and what’s still unfinished.</li>
    <li><strong>Systems thinking</strong> — I map flows, write runbooks, and treat even small demos like they deserve documentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth mindset</strong> — I’m upfront about gaps (algorithms, low-level work) and look for mentors who can help me close them.</li>

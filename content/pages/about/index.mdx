    Before tech, I served as a medic in the U.S. Army, worked in security, case management, construction, and animal rescue. Those jobs taught me discipline, communication, and how to adapt under pressure. Now I approach engineering the same way. Identify the issue, fix it, keep things stable.

  <p>Before diving into tech, I served as a medic in the U.S. Army, managing high-stakes situations that demanded quick thinking and precision. My time in security, case management, construction, and animal rescue honed my ability to adapt and solve problems under pressure. These experiences shape my engineering approach: identify the core issue, implement reliable fixes, and ensure systems stay resilient. It's why I prioritize scalable, secure solutions in every project.</p>

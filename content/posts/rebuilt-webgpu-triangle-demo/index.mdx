I built my Triangle Demo because I wanted a clean WebGPU study lab that made sense for how I learn. I originally forked a public WebGPU project that showed what was possible, and it gave me the push to start exploring how triangle rendering works. The original project was great, but it had a completely different purpose and long-term direction. What I wanted was something smaller, simpler, and focused only on the “hello triangle” and “textured cube” fundamentals.

So instead of trying to bend something bigger into a study tool, I decided to rebuild my own version from the ground up.

## Why I needed my own structure

Once I started exploring WebGPU, I realized I learn best when everything in a project is built by me, for me, and matches what I’m trying to study. I needed:

- a minimal layout  
- no extra abstraction layers  
- short TypeScript files I could read in one sitting  
- a UI shell I understood  
- a direct mapping from code to canvas

Not because anything else was wrong, but because I wanted a space where every file existed for one reason — to help me understand the pipeline.

## Building it clean

I rebuilt the entire demo using tools I already use daily:

- **Next.js 16** for the UI  
- **NextUI** for the layout  
- **Bun** for scripts and static exports  
- a single `/lib/webgpu` folder that holds the render loop logic  
- compact TypeScript files for the triangle and cube demos  
- simple WGSL shaders with no extra complexity

I wrote my own initialization steps:

1. request the adapter  
2. request the device  
3. configure the canvas  
4. create buffers  
5. load WGSL  
6. submit draws

With everything written by me from scratch, I could finally see exactly how each piece of the pipeline fits together.

## What the rebuild gave me

This rebuild wasn’t about fixing anything. It was about **clarity**.

The new setup gives me:

- a WebGPU project I fully understand  
- a clean space to tweak shaders  
- a simple path to experiment with buffers, attributes, and color outputs  
- direct connection between the code and what I see on the canvas  
- a predictable structure I can keep expanding as I learn

Instead of navigating around a larger ecosystem with its own goals, I now have a focused lab designed specifically for learning WebGPU fundamentals. That alone made the rebuild worth it.

## What I learned

Rebuilding this demo taught me more than I expected:

- how the adapter/device negotiation really works  
- how pipelines, buffers, and shaders interact  
- how the render loop lives and breathes  
- how small changes in WGSL show up instantly on the canvas  
- how much easier learning is when the project matches your learning style

This project is not an engine. Not a framework. Not a competitor to anything. It is just a compact, personal study lab that helps me understand the basics without distractions.

## Final thoughts

The new Triangle Demo is clean, simple, and built entirely around learning. It keeps the triangle and the textured cube close at hand so I can focus on the actual WebGPU pipeline instead of navigating around unrelated features.

It is the version that finally made WebGPU click for me, and it gives me a foundation to keep experimenting as the API evolves.

This is a learning demo. It broke a lot before it worked.

I wrote this post to capture the fixes and the exact steps.

You will get the core steps and a checklist you can reuse.

## The promise

You will learn:

- what broke and why
- how I fixed it
- how I documented it

> "If the demo is small, the fix is clear."

## What changed

- Cleaned up shader inputs
- Fixed the render loop
- Wrote a short note

### Example render loop

```js
function frame() {
  // update
  // draw
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
```

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Start with a minimal triangle.
2. Add one change at a time.
3. Log each fix.

### Common mistakes

- Changing too much at once.
- Skipping error logs.
- Not saving the working version.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Minimal triangle works
- [ ] One fix per change
- [ ] Notes updated

## Next steps

- Add a small performance note.
- Add a simple controls panel.
- Keep the demo small.

This post is a full rebuild guide for a small WebGPU demo.

It focuses on the fixes that made the demo stable.

You will get the steps, verification, and common mistakes.

If you are debugging a WebGPU demo, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a rebuild process for a small GPU demo.

Low level, it is a set of fixes with verification checks.

Key terms:

- **Render loop**: the function that redraws each frame.
- **Pipeline**: the GPU setup for a draw call.
- **Shader**: the GPU program that controls drawing.

## What you need

- A working WebGPU setup.
- A simple triangle demo.
- A browser with WebGPU support.

Docs used:

- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/webgpu/

## Start to finish

1) Start from the smallest triangle.

Why: You need a baseline.

2) Replace one part at a time.

Why: You need to isolate changes.

3) Log errors after each change.

Why: WebGPU errors are easy to miss.

### Example render loop

```js
function frame() {
  // update
  // draw
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
```

## Verify it worked

- The triangle renders.
- No WebGPU errors in the console.
- The demo stays stable for 30 seconds.

If it fails, revert one change at a time.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Nothing renders.
  **Cause**: Pipeline or shader mismatch.
  **Fix**: Check shader inputs and pipeline layout.

- **Symptom**: Flicker or crash.
  **Cause**: Render loop errors.
  **Fix**: Simplify the loop.

- **Symptom**: Random errors.
  **Cause**: Changes in too many files.
  **Fix**: Change one file at a time.

## Cheat sheet

- Start with a minimal triangle.
- Change one piece at a time.
- Verify after each change.

## Next steps

- Add a color toggle.
- Add a resize handler.

My navbar kept breaking after deploy. Locally it looked fine.

This post shows how I found the real cause and fixed it.

You will get a simple checklist and a small code snippet.

## The promise

You will learn:

- how I isolated the issue
- how I verified the fix
- how to avoid the same trap

> "If it only breaks in deploy, your build is part of the bug."

## What broke

- Links worked locally.
- Links failed on the deployed site.

## The fix

It was a routing mismatch. I had to align the path and the build output.

### Example snippet

```jsx
import { Link } from "gatsby";

<Link to="/about/">About</Link>
```

## CTA: Open the repo

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Reproduce the bug in a clean build.
2. Check output paths in the build folder.
3. Compare local paths to deployed paths.

### Common mistakes

- Assuming dev server paths match deploy paths.
- Forgetting a trailing slash setting.
- Fixing symptoms instead of the build config.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Build output verified
- [ ] Link paths match output
- [ ] Deploy tested

## Next steps

- Add a small routing note to your README.
- Run a build before every share.

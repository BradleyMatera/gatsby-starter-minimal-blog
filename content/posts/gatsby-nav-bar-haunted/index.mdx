My navbar broke after deploy even though it worked locally.

This post shows the full debug path and the fix.

You will learn how to reproduce, verify, and prevent it.

If your Gatsby nav breaks only in production, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a routing mismatch caused by build output and path config.

Low level, it is a check of link paths, build output, and trailing slash settings.

Key terms:

- **Base path**: the prefix your site uses when hosted in a subfolder.
- **Trailing slash**: whether URLs end in `/` or not.
- **Build output**: the HTML files Gatsby generates.

## What you need

- A Gatsby site.
- Access to the build output folder.
- A deploy where the bug happens.

Docs used:

- https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/

## Start to finish

1) Rebuild the site locally.

Why: You need the output that matches the deploy.

```bash
gatsby build
```

2) Inspect the `public` folder.

Why: You need to know the real paths.

```bash
ls public
```

3) Compare link paths with output paths.

Why: If they do not match, nav fails.

Example:

```jsx
<Link to="/about/">About</Link>
```

4) Check trailing slash settings.

Why: Gatsby can generate different paths based on this.

5) Deploy and test in a private window.

Why: It removes cache effects.

## Verify it worked

- Nav links load the correct pages.
- No 404s after deploy.
- The same links work in a private window.

If it still fails, check the deploy base path.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Works locally, fails in deploy.
  **Cause**: Base path mismatch.
  **Fix**: Align base path and links.

- **Symptom**: Random 404s.
  **Cause**: Trailing slash mismatch.
  **Fix**: Set trailingSlash and update links.

- **Symptom**: Old links still load.
  **Cause**: Cache.
  **Fix**: Use a private window and clear cache.

## Cheat sheet

- Build locally.
- Inspect `public` paths.
- Match links to output.
- Test in a private window.

## Next steps

- Add a short routing note in your README.
- Run a build before sharing links.

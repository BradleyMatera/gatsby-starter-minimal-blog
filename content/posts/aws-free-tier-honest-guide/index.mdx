The free tier is only free if you keep tracking it.

This post shows a short list of checks that prevent surprise bills.

You will set up a budget alert and audit active resources.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- check what is running in your account
- set a cost alert
- verify the alert works

> "If you cannot see the cost, it will surprise you."

## What this is

**High level:** The free tier is a set of limited monthly allowances.

**Low level:** You track running resources and set a budget alert in AWS Billing.

**Key terms:**

- **Free tier:** AWS usage limits that are free for a period.
- **Budget alert:** A notification triggered by cost thresholds.

## What you need

- AWS account
- Access to Billing
- Email address for alerts

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Audit active resources
Goal:
Find what is currently running.

Actions:
- AWS Console → EC2 → Instances
- Stop anything you do not need.
- AWS Console → RDS → Databases
- Delete unused databases.

Why:
Most surprise bills come from resources left running. EC2 and RDS are the usual suspects. This step reduces risk quickly. It also tells you what you are paying for.

Verify:
- Expected: only the resources you intend to keep are running.
- This confirms your account is clean.

If it fails:
- Symptom: resources reappear.
- Fix: check for auto scaling or scheduled instances.

### Step 2: Create a budget alert
Goal:
Get notified before costs spike.

Actions:
- AWS Console → Billing → Budgets → Create budget
- Budget type: Cost
- Amount: `$5`
- Alerts: Email

Why:
A small budget alert is cheap insurance. It tells you early when something is wrong. It also makes the free tier safer. This is the easiest guardrail you can add.

Verify:
- Expected: the budget appears in the list.
- This confirms the alert is set.

If it fails:
- Symptom: Budgets unavailable.  
  **Fix:** ensure Billing access is enabled in your account.

### Step 3: Check the cost explorer
Goal:
See where costs are coming from.

Actions:
- AWS Console → Cost Explorer
- Time range: last 7 days
- Group by: Service

Why:
Cost Explorer is the fastest way to see cost sources. Grouping by service tells you what to shut down first. This keeps your account honest. It also confirms the alert is not your only signal.

Verify:
- Expected: a chart listing services and costs.
- This confirms you have visibility.

If it fails:
- Symptom: Cost Explorer not enabled.
- Fix: enable it in Billing settings.

## Verify it worked

- Only intended resources are running.
- Budget alert exists.
- Cost Explorer shows data.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Costs appear without warning.  
  **Cause:** No budget alert.  
  **Fix:** create a small budget now.

- **Symptom:** Costs keep growing.  
  **Cause:** A resource is still running.  
  **Fix:** stop or delete unused resources.

- **Symptom:** You cannot access Billing.  
  **Cause:** Insufficient permissions.  
  **Fix:** enable billing access for your user.

## Cheat sheet

- Stop unused resources.
- Add a small budget alert.
- Check Cost Explorer weekly.

## Next steps

- Add a second alert at a higher threshold.
- Tag resources so you can group costs by project.

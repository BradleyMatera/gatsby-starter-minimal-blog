AWS free tier is useful, but it is not a shield.

This post shows the exact steps I use to keep lab costs under control.

You will set alerts, track usage, and clean up safely.

If you run labs, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a cost control workflow for labs.

Low level, it is a checklist with alerts, usage notes, and cleanup steps.

Key terms:

- **Free tier**: limited AWS usage that does not cost money within specific limits.
- **Budget alert**: a notification when spend crosses a set amount.
- **Cleanup**: deleting resources so they do not keep billing.

## What you need

- An AWS account.
- Access to Billing and Cost Management.
- A small monthly lab budget.

Docs used:

- https://aws.amazon.com/free/
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/

## Start to finish

1) Set a budget alert.

Why: You need an early warning before spend grows.

2) Pick one service for your lab.

Why: Fewer services means easier tracking.

3) Log your expected usage.

Why: You need a baseline for cost math.

4) Run the lab.

Why: You need real usage data.

5) Record actual usage.

Why: You need to compare expected vs actual.

6) Clean up the resources.

Why: Idle resources keep billing.

### Example cost math

```text
Monthly storage cost = GB-month * price_per_gb
Request cost = requests * price_per_request
Total = storage + request cost
```

## Verify it worked

- The budget alert exists.
- Usage numbers are in your notes.
- The resources are deleted.

If you still see charges, check for hidden resources like snapshots.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Unexpected charges.
  **Cause**: Resources left running.
  **Fix**: Delete and confirm in the console.

- **Symptom**: No alert emails.
  **Cause**: Budget alert not configured.
  **Fix**: Create the alert and test it.

- **Symptom**: Costs are unclear.
  **Cause**: No usage notes.
  **Fix**: Log usage right after the lab.

## Cheat sheet

- Set a budget alert first.
- Keep labs small.
- Record usage and costs.
- Clean up the same day.

## Next steps

- Add a short cleanup checklist to your notes.
- Try a second lab with a new service.
- Keep the budget number visible.

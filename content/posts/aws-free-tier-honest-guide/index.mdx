AWS free tier is useful, but it is not magic.

This post shows a simple budget plan I use for labs. It keeps costs visible and small.

You will get a checklist, a cost math example, and the common mistakes I made.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- know what to watch
- log costs in a simple way
- avoid common free-tier traps

> "If the cost is unclear, the lab is not done."

## Start with a tiny budget

Set a small limit for your lab month. I use a small number and treat it as a hard cap.

If you are not sure, set it lower. You can always raise it later.

### Example cost math

```text
Monthly storage cost = GB-month * price_per_gb
Request cost = requests * price_per_request
Total = storage + request cost
```

## How I track it

- A simple note with service, usage, and price.
- A weekly check of the billing page.
- A short summary in my lab notes.

### Quick checklist

- [ ] Budget alert set
- [ ] Usage note updated weekly
- [ ] Delete unused resources

## CTA: Open the notes template

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick one service for a lab.
2. Write the usage you expect.
3. Set an alert below your cap.
4. Clean up on the same day.

### Common mistakes

- Leaving resources running.
- Forgetting data transfer costs.
- Relying on free tier without checking the clock.

## Next steps

- Add a cleanup checklist to your lab notes.
- Review costs at the end of the week.
- Repeat with a second service.

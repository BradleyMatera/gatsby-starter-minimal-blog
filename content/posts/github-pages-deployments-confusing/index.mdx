GitHub Pages is simple once you wire the base path correctly.

This post shows a minimal deployment flow with exact files and checks.

You will publish a static build and verify the live URL.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- set the correct base path
- publish to GitHub Pages
- verify the live URL works

> "If the base path is wrong, every asset breaks."

## What this is

**High level:** GitHub Pages hosts static files from a branch or a folder.

**Low level:** You build the site into a folder and push that folder to `gh-pages`.

**Key terms:**

- **Base path:** The URL prefix where your site lives.
- **Static build:** The output folder with HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- **Pages branch:** The branch GitHub Pages serves from.

## What you need

- A GitHub repo
- A build command that outputs static files
- A `gh-pages` deploy script or manual branch push

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Set the base path
Goal:
Make sure the app uses the repo name as the base path.

Actions:
- File path: `package.json`
- Add or confirm:
  ```json
  {
    "homepage": "https://yourname.github.io/your-repo"
  }
  ```

Why:
GitHub Pages hosts your site under a repo path. Without the base path, your assets point to `/` and break. This one line fixes 90 percent of broken deployments. It also makes local and production builds consistent.

Verify:
- Run:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- Open the generated `index.html` and confirm asset URLs include `/your-repo/`.
- This confirms the base path is applied.

If it fails:
- Symptom: assets still point to `/`.
- Fix: ensure the `homepage` value is exact and rebuild.

### Step 2: Add a deploy script
Goal:
Publish the build folder to GitHub Pages.

Actions:
- Install the deploy tool:
  ```bash
  npm install -D gh-pages
  ```
- File path: `package.json`
- Add:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
    }
  }
  ```
- Replace `dist` with your build output folder.

Why:
`gh-pages` pushes your build output to the Pages branch. The script keeps the command consistent. This makes your deploy repeatable. It also reduces mistakes when you publish updates.

Verify:
- Run:
  ```bash
  npm run deploy
  ```
- Expected: a new `gh-pages` branch is created.
- This confirms the deploy script worked.

If it fails:
- Symptom: `ENOENT` for the build folder.
- Fix: check your build output folder name.

### Step 3: Turn on GitHub Pages
Goal:
Enable GitHub Pages for the repo.

Actions:
- GitHub repo settings → Pages
- Source: Deploy from branch
- Branch: `gh-pages`
- Folder: `/`

Why:
GitHub Pages does not serve anything until it is configured. Picking the correct branch is the most common mistake. This step makes the site live. It is a one time setup.

Verify:
- Open the Pages URL provided by GitHub.
- Expected: your site loads with CSS and JS.
- This confirms the site is live.

If it fails:
- Symptom: 404 or blank page.
- Fix: wait for the build to finish, then hard reload.

## Verify it worked

- The live URL loads.
- CSS and JS assets load without 404s.
- Refreshing does not break routes.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Blank page with console errors.  
  **Cause:** Wrong base path.  
  **Fix:** set `homepage` and rebuild.

- **Symptom:** 404 on the root URL.  
  **Cause:** Pages not enabled or wrong branch.  
  **Fix:** enable Pages on the `gh-pages` branch.

- **Symptom:** Old version keeps showing.  
  **Cause:** Browser cache.  
  **Fix:** hard reload and clear cache.

## Cheat sheet

- Set `homepage` to the repo URL.
- Build the site.
- Deploy to `gh-pages`.
- Enable Pages in settings.

## Next steps

- Add a custom domain if you have one.
- Add a README section with deploy steps.

Make the base path correct first. Everything else is secondary.

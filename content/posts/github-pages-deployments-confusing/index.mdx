GitHub Pages feels confusing for one reason: base paths. Once you understand that your site does not live at `/` but at `/your-repo/`, every broken deployment you’ve ever seen suddenly makes sense. This guide is start to finish. It uses real commands, real files, and real verification steps. No shortcuts. No magic. When you finish, you will have a live URL that works, refreshes correctly, and serves assets without 404s.

This is not a theory post. It is a lab you can run in any static site project.

## The promise

By the end, three things will be true. Your project will build into a static folder. That folder will be published to a `gh-pages` branch. The live GitHub Pages URL will load with working CSS and JavaScript. If any of those are missing, the setup is incomplete.

## What GitHub Pages actually is

At a high level, GitHub Pages is just a static file host wired directly into your repository. You push a folder of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to a specific branch, and GitHub serves it at a predictable URL. No servers. No containers. No runtime. Just files on disk served over HTTP.

At a low level, GitHub Pages does exactly three things. It watches a branch. It copies the files from that branch to its hosting layer. It assigns your repo a URL. Everything else people get stuck on is configuration around paths and build output.

The only term that matters is the base path. Your site will live at:

`https://yourname.github.io/your-repo/`

If your app thinks it lives at `/`, every asset will point to the wrong place in production. That is the entire source of the confusion.

## What you need before touching anything

You need a GitHub repository. You need a build command that outputs a static folder. You need to be able to run that build locally without errors. If your local build is broken, GitHub Pages will faithfully publish a broken build.

Nothing else is required. No paid services. No API keys. No secret configs.

## Start to finish

### Step 1: Set the base path

The first fix is always the same. You tell your project what URL it will live under in production. In most JavaScript static site setups, that is done with a `homepage` field in `package.json`.

File:
`package.json`

Add or confirm:

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://yourname.github.io/your-repo"
}
```

This one line changes how the build outputs asset URLs. Without it, assets point to `/assets/...`. With it, assets point to `/your-repo/assets/...`. That is the difference between a working site and a blank page with console errors.

Verification:

Run a local build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Open the generated `index.html` inside the build folder. Inspect the `<script>` and `<link>` tags. If you see `/your-repo/` in the paths, the base path is correct. If you still see `/`, the value is wrong or the build tool did not pick it up.

If this step is skipped or wrong, every later step will technically succeed but the deployed site will be broken. Fix the base path first. Always.

### Step 2: Add a deploy script

Once the build folder is correct, you need a repeatable way to publish it. The simplest approach is the `gh-pages` npm package. It pushes a local folder to a remote `gh-pages` branch in your repository.

Install it:

```bash
npm install -D gh-pages
```

Now wire a deploy command.

File:
`package.json`

Add:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

Replace `dist` with whatever folder your build actually outputs. Some tools use `build`, some use `public`. The command must point to the folder that contains `index.html`.

This script does one thing. It takes your local build output and pushes it to a branch named `gh-pages`. That branch is what GitHub Pages will serve.

Verification:

Run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Expected result: a new branch named `gh-pages` appears in your GitHub repository. If it does, the publishing step worked.

If it fails, the error will almost always say the folder does not exist. That means the build output folder name in your script does not match your actual build.

### Step 3: Turn on GitHub Pages

Publishing the branch is not enough. You still need to tell GitHub to serve that branch.

Open your repository on GitHub. Go to Settings → Pages. Under Source, select:

- Deploy from branch
- Branch: `gh-pages`
- Folder: `/`

Save. GitHub will now build and host your branch. After a short delay, it will show you the live URL.

Verification:

Open the URL GitHub provides. The page should load with styling and JavaScript working. Open DevTools → Network. There should be no 404s for CSS or JS files.

If you see a blank page or console errors, go back to Step 1. It is almost always the base path.

## Verify it worked

A correct deployment has three properties. The root URL loads. Refreshing the page does not break routing. Assets load without 404 errors. If those are true, your GitHub Pages deployment is complete.

## Common failure patterns

A blank page with red console errors is a wrong base path. A 404 at the Pages URL is a branch or settings issue. An old version showing after a successful deploy is browser caching. None of these require guesswork. Each maps directly to one of the steps above.

## Why this feels harder than it is

GitHub Pages itself is simple. The confusion comes from modern front-end tools defaulting to `/` as the base path, while GitHub Pages requires `/repo-name/`. Once you align those two, the rest is mechanical.

You are not configuring a server. You are not managing infrastructure. You are just building files and telling GitHub which branch to serve. That’s all that’s happening.

## Closing

If you set the base path, build locally, push the build folder to `gh-pages`, and enable Pages in repo settings, your deployment will work. Every time. If it doesn’t, one of those four steps is wrong, not GitHub Pages itself.

GitHub Pages fails fast when the base path is wrong.

This post shows a full fix with setup, verification, and cleanup.

You will get the exact steps and a checklist you can reuse.

If your Pages site breaks after deploy, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, Pages hosts static files under a repo path.

Low level, your app needs a base path that matches the repo name.

Key terms:

- **Base path**: the URL prefix for a repo site.
- **Project site**: a Pages site served from a repo, not a custom domain.
- **Deploy**: pushing a build output to Pages.

## What you need

- A GitHub repo.
- A built static site.
- GitHub Pages enabled.

Docs used:

- https://docs.github.com/pages

## Start to finish

1) Confirm the repo name.

Why: The base path must match it.

2) Set the base path in your config.

Why: Static assets must resolve to the repo path.

Example `next.config.js`:

```js
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";

module.exports = {
  basePath: isProd ? "/MyRepoName" : "",
};
```

3) Build the site.

Why: You need the correct output for Pages.

```bash
npm run build
```

4) Deploy to Pages.

Why: The build output must be published.

## Verify it worked

- The home page loads.
- Assets load without 404s.
- Links work in a private window.

If assets 404, the base path is still wrong.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: CSS and JS 404.
  **Cause**: Missing base path.
  **Fix**: Set base path and rebuild.

- **Symptom**: Works locally, fails on Pages.
  **Cause**: Using local root paths.
  **Fix**: Use the repo path in config.

- **Symptom**: Stale assets.
  **Cause**: Cached service worker.
  **Fix**: Unregister the service worker.

## Cheat sheet

- Base path must equal repo name.
- Build before deploy.
- Test in a private window.

## Next steps

- Add a short deploy note to README.
- Keep a small checklist in the repo.

My GitHub Pages demo broke after deploy. The code was fine.

The problem was one setting. This post shows the fix and the checklist I now follow.

You will get the exact steps and a short list of mistakes to avoid.

## The promise

You will learn:

- which Pages setting matters most
- how to verify the deploy
- how to avoid stale assets

> "If the URL is wrong, the deploy is wrong."

## The fix

I had the wrong base path for a project site.

### Example base path setup

```js
// next.config.js example
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";

module.exports = {
  basePath: isProd ? "/MyRepoName" : "",
};
```

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Confirm the repo name.
2. Set the base path if needed.
3. Rebuild and redeploy.
4. Test the site in a private window.

### Common mistakes

- Leaving the base path blank.
- Pushing without rebuilding.
- Forgetting to clear stale service workers.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Base path matches repo name
- [ ] New build published
- [ ] Live site tested

## Next steps

- Add a deploy note to your README.
- Keep a small checklist in the repo.

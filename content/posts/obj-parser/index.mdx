  <h1 class="content-heading-1">Parsing OBJ Files: A Journey into 3D Data</h1>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    Working with 3D models often requires understanding and parsing file formats like OBJ, a widely used format for storing 3D geometry. In this post, I discuss my experience building an OBJ parser as part of a larger WebGPU project, focusing on the challenges and solutions I encountered.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">What is an OBJ File?</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    An OBJ file is a text-based format for representing 3D geometry, including vertices, texture coordinates, normals, and faces. It's simple and human-readable, making it a popular choice for 3D modeling software and rendering applications.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Project Context</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    As part of my WebGPU Shapes Renderer project, I needed to load 3D models to render them using WebGPU. I decided to write a custom OBJ parser in JavaScript to extract the necessary data for rendering.

  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Building the Parser</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    The parser needed to read an OBJ file line by line, identifying keywords like <code class="content-code">v</code> for vertices, <code class="content-code">vt</code> for texture coordinates, <code class="content-code">vn</code> for normals, and <code class="content-code">f</code> for faces. I used JavaScript's string manipulation methods to split and process each line into usable data structures.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Challenges Faced</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Complex Face Definitions</strong>: OBJ files can define faces with varying numbers of vertices and optional texture or normal indices. I had to test different formats to ensure my parser handled all cases, eventually using regular expressions to parse the indices correctly.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Data Size</strong>: Large models meant large files. Initial parsing was slow, so I optimized by pre-allocating arrays and minimizing string operations after testing with bigger models.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">What I Learned</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item">Understanding the structure of 3D data and how it's stored in text formats like OBJ.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">Writing robust parsers that handle edge cases through iterative testing and debugging.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">The importance of performance optimization when dealing with potentially large datasets in web applications.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    Building an OBJ parser was a deep dive into the world of 3D graphics data. It taught me not just about file formats, but also about problem-solving and optimization in a real-world context.

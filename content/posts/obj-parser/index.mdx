Hey, I’m Brad. I started this OBJ Parser project for a class at Full Sail University (where I’m wrapping up my web dev degree, Aug 2023 - Oct 2025, 3.85 GPA). The point wasn’t to make something huge—it was to figure out Zig, a language I’d never used, and understand 3D parsing basics. I mixed in some JavaScript and PixiJS too, just to see it work. Here’s why I built it, how I messed with it, and what I learned, even though it’s not done yet. You can peek at it on [github.com/BradleyMatera/obj-parser](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/obj-parser).

### Why I Built It
I’d done JavaScript stuff before—like my Pokedex—but Zig was new. Class said it’s fast and gives you control, not like JavaScript where garbage collection does the work. I wanted to see that for myself, so I picked parsing OBJ files (those 3D model things) because it sounded cool—turning text into shapes I could maybe show later. I wasn’t aiming to finish a big parser; I just wanted to get the basics of Zig and 3D files. Plus, I had some Blender OBJ files (like a cube) to test with, so I threw those in.

### How I Started It
I set up a project with Zig files—`main.zig` to run it, `root.zig` for the parser—and added example files (`cube.obj`, `cube.mtl`) from Blender. The OBJ file has lines like:
```plaintext
v 1.0 1.0 1.0  # A vertex at (1,1,1)
f 1 2 3        # A triangle face
```
I wanted to read those and pull out the points. In Zig, I started with something like this in `main.zig`:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;
    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile("examples/cube.obj", .{});
    defer file.close();

    const content = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, 1024 * 1024);
    defer allocator.free(content);

    std.debug.print("File content: {s}\n", .{content});
}
```
It just opens the file and prints it—super basic. I had no clue about Zig’s `try` or `defer` at first, so I kept breaking it—like forgetting `defer` and wondering why it leaked memory. Testing it with `zig run src/main.zig` showed me the file’s text, and that’s when I got excited to parse it.

### Trying to Parse It
I moved to `root.zig` to split the OBJ lines. I wanted to grab vertices (the `v` lines) and faces (the `f` lines). Here’s a bit I worked on:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub const Vertex = struct {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
    z: f32,
};

pub fn parseOBJ(content: []const u8, allocator: std.mem.Allocator) ![]Vertex {
    var vertices = std.ArrayList(Vertex).init(allocator);
    defer vertices.deinit();

    var lines = std.mem.split(u8, content, "\n");
    while (lines.next()) |line| {
        if (std.mem.startsWith(u8, line, "v ")) {
            var parts = std.mem.split(u8, line[2..], " ");
            const x = try std.fmt.parseFloat(f32, parts.next().?);
            const y = try std.fmt.parseFloat(f32, parts.next().?);
            const z = try std.fmt.parseFloat(f32, parts.next().?);
            try vertices.append(Vertex{ .x = x, .y = y, .z = z });
        }
    }
    return vertices.toOwnedSlice();
}
```
This grabs `v` lines—like `v 1.0 2.0 3.0`—and turns them into a `Vertex` struct. I tested it with my cube file, but it crashed on empty lines. I had to add checks—like `if (line.len > 2)`—and that’s when I started getting how Zig makes you handle errors yourself.

### Why Zig?
I could’ve stuck with JavaScript—it’s easier with stuff like:
```javascript
const vertices = [];
const lines = file.split('\n');
lines.forEach(line => {
  if (line.startsWith('v ')) {
    const [_, x, y, z] = line.split(' ').map(parseFloat);
    vertices.push({ x, y, z });
  }
});
```
But Zig forced me to think about memory. In JS, I didn’t care—garbage collection handled it. In Zig, I had to use `allocator` and `defer` to free stuff, like `vertices.deinit()`. I broke it a bunch—forgot to free memory, got crashes—and fixed it by reading the docs. It was a pain, but I liked seeing how low-level stuff works.

### Adding PixiJS for Fun
I didn’t stop at Zig—I wanted to see the shapes. So I added a JavaScript part with PixiJS (from my Pong project). I’d parse in Zig, save it to a binary file (not done yet), then load it in JS:
```javascript
const app = new PIXI.Application({ width: 800, height: 600 });
document.body.appendChild(app.view);
const graphics = new PIXI.Graphics();
graphics.beginFill(0xffffff);
graphics.drawPolygon([100, 100, 200, 200, 300, 100]); // A test triangle
app.stage.addChild(graphics);
```
I tested it with a hardcoded triangle—worked fine—but I haven’t linked the Zig output yet. I broke the PixiJS part by messing up coordinates (e.g., `300, -100` went off-screen), fixed it, and learned how 3D points turn into visuals.

### What I Learned
This wasn’t about finishing a perfect parser—it’s half-baked right now. I built it to learn Zig basics: how it handles memory, errors, and structs. I got that by crashing it—like forgetting `try` and seeing `error: expected type 'void'`—and fixing it step-by-step. The OBJ part taught me 3D files aren’t magic—just text I can break down. And PixiJS showed me how parsing leads to stuff you can see. It’s a mess, but I had fun figuring it out. Check the repo at [github.com/BradleyMatera/obj-parser](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/obj-parser)—it’s got my Zig code, examples, and notes.

### Why It Matters
I’m not a pro—this is me learning by doing. Zig’s tough, but it made me think about what’s under the hood, not just slap code together. I want to keep going—maybe finish the binary output or parse faces next—but for now, it’s a real start to understanding 3D and a new language.

I made a JavaScript tool to parse 3D OBJ files for a class. It reads the file and pulls out shapes, then I used PixiJS to show them. Tested it with different files—found one that crashed it and fixed the loop. It’s a cool experiment. See it at [github.com/BradleyMatera/obj-parser](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/obj-parser).

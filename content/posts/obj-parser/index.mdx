This is a small parser exercise. It is not production code.

I wrote this post to capture the logic and the mistakes while I built it.

You will get a short summary, a snippet, and a checklist.

## The promise

You will learn:

- the parsing approach I used
- how I logged errors
- what I would change next

> "Small parsers teach big lessons."

## The approach

I kept parsing strict and logging simple. That made bugs obvious.

### Example parse loop

```zig
while (try reader.readUntilDelimiterOrEofAlloc(allocator, '\n', 2048)) |line| {
    if (line.len == 0) continue;
    // parse by prefix
}
```

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick one format.
2. Parse one line type.
3. Write one error test.

### Common mistakes

- Allowing silent failures.
- Ignoring memory usage.
- Skipping tiny test files.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] One token parsed
- [ ] One error case tested
- [ ] Notes written

## Next steps

- Add benchmarks.
- Add a file size guard.
- Document edge cases.

If you want the test files, ask and I will share them.

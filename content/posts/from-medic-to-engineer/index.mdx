## TL;DR

- **Army discipline fuels modern incident response.** The triage mindset keeps on-call rotations calm and focused on the riskiest alerts first.  
- **Service roles sharpened stakeholder communication.** Case management, security, and rescue work taught me to translate technical detail into plain-language next steps.  
- **Hands-on trades built adaptability.** Construction schedules and scarce resources mirror feature pivots, so I plan for change instead of fighting it.  
- **Engineering is an evolution, not a reset.** Every previous job now powers how I model systems, lead crews, and build resilient products.

## Career Timeline

1. **Army Background:** Trained as a combat medic, triaged casualties in the field, and led teams through high-stress emergencies.  
2. **Career Pivot:** Shifted into security, case management, construction, and animal rescue—roles that demanded empathy, logistics, and steady communication.  
3. **Software Engineering:** Formalised technical skills, built end-to-end products, and now channel the same mission-first mindset into shipping reliable software.

## Transferable Skills (Medic vs Engineer)

- **Medic → Incident Response**  
	- *Medic:* Stabilise multiple patients, label severity, and loop in specialists fast.  
	- *Engineer:* Orchestrate production triage, classify alerts, and route fixes to the right owners.  
- **Case Manager → Stakeholder Alignment**  
	- *Case Manager:* Keep patients, families, and providers aligned through clear updates.  
	- *Engineer:* Communicate root causes, mitigation timelines, and trade-offs with product, design, and leadership.  
- **Construction Worker → Adaptive Planning**  
	- *Construction:* Work from blueprints yet adapt when materials or weather shift.  
	- *Engineer:* Iterate on architecture when constraints surface, refactor safely, and preserve launch objectives.  
- **Animal Rescue → Pragmatic Delivery**  
	- *Rescuer:* Stay calm with limited gear and make decisions that protect lives.  
	- *Engineer:* Deliver customer impact under pressure, simplify scope, and triage backlog items to keep momentum.

## How the Mindset Shows Up in Engineering

- **Stabilise first, then automate.** Field medicine ingrained the habit of prioritising life-saving moves before long-term fixes. In software, I collect signals, confirm the blast radius, and restore service before chasing automation. Runbooks and service-level objectives are my digital triage tags.  
- **Communicate the story, not just the data.** Patient charts taught me to capture what happened, what changed, and what comes next. Now I structure incident write-ups, pull-request summaries, and handoff notes the same way so teammates can act fast.  
- **Plan for surprises.** Construction sites rarely go to plan, so guardrails and contingency plays matter. I scope features with “if this, then that” branches, validate assumptions early, and treat feedback as part of the blueprint.  
- **Lead with empathy.** Animal rescue reinforced that calm leadership wins trust. During outages or code reviews, I acknowledge stress, set the tone, and guide teams toward the next right move.

## Advice for Career-Changers

- **Catalogue transferable skills.** Map each prior responsibility to an engineering scenario—incident drills, sprint cadences, or stakeholder rituals.  
- **Build on strengths.** If you excel at crisis management, propose improvements to on-call runbooks; if logistics is your superpower, own project timelines.  
- **Invest in technical foundations.** Certifications, degrees, bootcamps, and self-led labs provide the vocabulary to pair your soft skills with hard skills.  
- **Tell your story with intent.** Frame your pivot as a continuation of service. Explain the moment you chose software and how your background unlocks outcomes for users.

## Key Takeaways

- **Your previous career is an asset, not baggage.** Translate the language of your past roles into engineering outcomes.  
- **Calm, empathetic leadership scales across industries.** Use it to anchor teams during incidents, launches, and retrospectives.  
- **Flexibility beats perfection.** Adapt plans with the same grit you used in the field; resilient systems emerge from resilient people.

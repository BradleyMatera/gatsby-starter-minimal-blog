## Introduction

Long before I wrote JavaScript, I served as a U.S. Army medic and later worked in security, case management, construction, and animal rescue. Each role demanded rapid assessment, empathy, and disciplined execution. When I pivoted into engineering, I discovered that the same instincts—triage, communication, and adaptability—are invaluable in building software that keeps people safe and productive.

## Translating Experience into Engineering

| Past Role | Core Skill | Engineering Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Combat medic | Triage multiple patients, prioritise critical issues | Debugging production incidents, prioritising alerts |
| Case manager | Communicate with diverse stakeholders | Collaborating with product, design, and leadership |
| Construction worker | Follow plans, adapt to material constraints | Interpreting requirements, refactoring when assumptions change |
| Animal rescue | Stay calm with limited resources | Delivering under pressure, choosing pragmatic solutions |

### Triage and Incident Response
Field medicine taught me to stabilise patients before anything else. In engineering, I apply the same approach to outages: gather signals, categorise severity, and address the most critical blockers first. Tools like on-call runbooks and service-level objectives mirror military triage sheets—they keep teams aligned when seconds matter.

### Communication Under Pressure
Case management and security roles demanded clear, compassionate communication. Today, when I explain a root cause to stakeholders or pair-program with a teammate, I aim for the same clarity. A well-written incident report is not unlike a patient chart: it tells the story, records interventions, and guides follow-up care.

### Adapting Plans in Construction
Construction projects rarely go exactly as planned. When materials arrive late or designs clash with reality, crews adapt without sacrificing safety. In software, we iterate on architecture diagrams, adjust scope when feedback arrives, and refactor when requirements evolve. Resilience comes from accepting change while preserving core objectives.

## Advice for Career-Changers

- **Catalogue transferable skills.** Map past responsibilities to engineering tasks. Interviewers value real-world examples of leadership, discipline, and empathy.  
- **Build on strengths.** If you’ve led emergency responses, highlight incident management or on-call readiness. If you coordinated logistics, emphasise project planning.  
- **Invest in technical foundations.** Structured learning (bootcamps, degrees, online courses) complements hands-on experience.  
- **Tell your story.** A cohesive narrative—why you switched fields and how your background informs your engineering practice—helps recruiters remember you.

## Conclusion

Pivoting careers is less about starting over and more about repurposing what you already know. The discipline, empathy, and calm I learned as a medic and case manager now guide how I design APIs, triage bugs, and support teammates. Your previous experiences can do the same. Bring them with you and use them to build systems—and teams—that are resilient when it matters most.

Transferable skills only matter if you can show them.

This post shows how I map real experience to concrete engineering behavior.

You will build a simple mapping doc and link it to real work.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- map past experience to specific engineering actions
- avoid vague claims and keep it provable
- build a short proof list you can show

> "If it cannot be shown, it should not be claimed."

## What this is

**High level:** This is a method to translate past roles into engineering behaviors without exaggeration.

**Low level:** You write a table that links a real behavior to a real artifact like a repo or note.

**Key terms:**

- **Behavior:** A concrete action you performed.
- **Artifact:** A file or link that proves the behavior.

## What you need

- A notes file
- A list of projects or posts you can link to

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create a skills map file
Goal:
Make a table that links experience to proof.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/skills-map.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Experience | Behavior | Proof
  Medic | Calm triage under pressure | Link to a debug post
  Operations | Process cleanup | Link to a checklist
  ```

Why:
A table forces clarity. It avoids vague phrases like "leadership" without proof. It also makes it easy to review and edit. This is the backbone of honest storytelling.

Verify:
- Open the file and confirm each row has a link you can click.
- This confirms the proof exists.

If it fails:
- Symptom: you cannot find proof.
- Fix: remove the row or replace it with a real artifact.

### Step 2: Add one real example
Goal:
Link one skill to a real engineering artifact.

Actions:
- Example row:
  ```text
  Medic | Structured communication | https://bradleymatera.dev/service-worker-held-site-hostage/
  ```

Why:
One real example is better than a list of vague traits. It shows you can connect experience to output. This keeps your story grounded. It also gives readers a place to verify.

Verify:
- Click the link.
- Expected: the post loads.
- This confirms the proof is accessible.

If it fails:
- Symptom: 404.
- Fix: update the URL or remove the row.

### Step 3: Add a short summary block
Goal:
Explain the mapping in one paragraph.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/skills-map.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Summary: I map past experience to specific, verifiable behaviors. If I cannot link it, I do not claim it.
  ```

Why:
The summary makes the intent explicit. It prevents overreach. It also helps readers understand the method quickly. This keeps the story consistent across pages.

Verify:
- The summary is one or two sentences.
- This confirms it is concise.

If it fails:
- Symptom: summary is long and vague.
- Fix: cut it to one sentence.

## Verify it worked

- The table exists.
- Each row has a working link.
- The summary is concise.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Skills sound like buzzwords.  
  **Cause:** No proof link.  
  **Fix:** add proof or delete the line.

- **Symptom:** Claims imply production ownership.  
  **Cause:** Overreach in wording.  
  **Fix:** use neutral, verifiable wording.

- **Symptom:** Too many rows.  
  **Cause:** Trying to list everything.  
  **Fix:** keep only what you can prove.

## Cheat sheet

- Map experience to behavior.
- Link behavior to proof.
- Cut anything unverified.

## Next steps

- Add two more proof links.
- Use the same table for your resume bullets.

## Final CTA

If you cannot prove it, do not claim it. That rule keeps the story strong.

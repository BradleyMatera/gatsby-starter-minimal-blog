This is not a hype post. It is a practical transfer guide.

Some skills carry over. Many do not. I list both.

You will get concrete examples and a checklist you can use.

If you are changing careers, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a mapping of real-world habits to software work.

Low level, it is a set of examples, notes, and steps for practice.

Key terms:

- **Transferable skill**: a habit that applies in a new context.
- **Debug log**: a short note that captures a problem and fix.
- **Practice loop**: repeatable steps to build a habit.

## What you need

- One small project you can change.
- A place to write short notes.
- A peer who can read your notes.

## Start to finish

1) Pick one habit to transfer.

Why: You cannot fix everything at once.

2) Translate it into a software action.

Why: Habits need a concrete action.

3) Practice it on one small bug.

Why: Small scope keeps it repeatable.

4) Write a short debug log.

Why: Notes make the habit visible.

### Example debug log

```text
Problem:
What I saw:
What I tried:
What fixed it:
```

## Verify it worked

- You can explain the bug in one paragraph.
- You can reproduce the fix.
- You can hand the note to someone else.

If you cannot reproduce it, the note is not done.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Notes are too long.
  **Cause**: Trying to capture everything.
  **Fix**: Keep it to four lines.

- **Symptom**: Habits do not stick.
  **Cause**: No repeat loop.
  **Fix**: Use the same steps for three weeks.

- **Symptom**: Claims sound bigger than they are.
  **Cause**: Vague language.
  **Fix**: Describe the exact action you took.

## Cheat sheet

- Pick one habit.
- Translate it to one action.
- Practice on one bug.
- Write a short log.

## Next steps

- Pick a second habit next month.
- Ask a peer to review your notes.

The job change is real. The skills transfer is uneven.

This post covers the specific habits that carried over and the parts that did not.

You will get concrete examples and a simple checklist you can apply.

## The promise

You will learn:

- which habits transfer cleanly
- which ones need retraining
- how I document the gap

> "Calm is useful. Clarity is better."

## What transferred

- Clear notes under stress.
- Communication that stays short and direct.

### Example note format

Problem:
What I saw:
What I tried:

```

## What did not transfer

- Production ownership. I do not claim that.
- Team-scale processes. I am still learning them.

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Write one short note after each bug.
2. Keep the language plain.
3. Share the note with a peer.

### Common mistakes

- Writing long notes no one reads.
- Hiding uncertainty.
- Claiming experience you do not have.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Fix is clear
- [ ] Gaps are written down

## Next steps

- Keep a weekly debug log.
- Pick one habit to improve each month.
- Ask for feedback on your notes.

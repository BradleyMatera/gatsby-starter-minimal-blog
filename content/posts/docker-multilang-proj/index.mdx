  <h1 class="content-heading-1">Docker Multilang Project: Containerizing Apps Across Languages</h1>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    In this project, I explored how to containerize applications written in multiple languages using Docker. The goal was to create a seamless environment where apps in Python, Node.js, and potentially other languages could run independently yet cohesively within their own containers.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Project Overview</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    The Docker Multilang Project focuses on setting up a multi-container environment using Docker Compose. Each container hosts an application written in a different programming language, showcasing how Docker can standardize deployment workflows regardless of the tech stack.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Docker</strong>: For containerization of the applications.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Python</strong>: One of the languages used for a sample app within a container.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Node.js</strong>: Another language for a different app in a separate container.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Key Features</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item">Multi-container setup with Docker Compose.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">Independent scaling and management of containers based on language-specific apps.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">Demonstrates portability and consistency across development and production environments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="content-heading-2">What I Learned</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    Working on this project taught me the power of containerization in managing dependencies and environments for different languages. I encountered challenges with networking between containers, which I resolved by defining proper network configurations in Docker Compose. Testing the setup with various app requirements helped me understand how to optimize Dockerfiles for efficiency.

This is a lab guide for small projects, not production.

I wrote it to keep my own steps clear when a repo has more than one language.

You will get the simplest setup, a checklist, and the mistakes I hit.

## The promise

You will learn how to:

- keep each service isolated
- run both with one command
- document the steps

> "Two languages are fine. Two unclear setups are not."

## Minimal setup

### Example compose file

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: ./api
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
  web:
    build: ./web
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

## CTA: Open the repo

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Split services into folders.
2. Add a Dockerfile per service.
3. Write a simple compose file.
4. Add a notes file with start and stop steps.

### Common mistakes

- Sharing env files between services.
- Forgetting port mappings.
- Hiding setup steps inside shell scripts only.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Dockerfiles build
- [ ] Compose runs both services
- [ ] Notes include start and stop steps

## Next steps

- Add a health check route.
- Add a small seed script.
- Keep the notes updated.

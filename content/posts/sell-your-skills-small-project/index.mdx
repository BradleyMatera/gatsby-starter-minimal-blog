Small projects are the fastest mechanism to demonstrate technical competence. A resume lists claims; a repository provides evidence.

This post documents how to scope, build, and document a "Skill Proof"—a micro-project designed to verify a single capability.

You will implement a specific feature, deploy it to a public URL, and write documentation that explains the technical decision-making process.

This is a lab guide. You should execute these steps locally to produce a portfolio asset.

## The promise

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Scoping a project to a single, verifiable technical skill.
- Implement a functional "Client-Side Search" demo using vanilla JavaScript.
- Deploy the project to a public URL.
- Structure a README that functions as technical documentation.

## What this is

**High level:** A Skill Proof is a contained project that demonstrates proficiency in one specific area (e.g., API integration, state management, or performance optimization) without the overhead of a full application.

**Low level:** You will create a single HTML file that fetches data and filters it, push it to GitHub, and deploy it via a static host.

**Key terms:**

- **Scope Creep:** The tendency to add unnecessary features (like authentication or complex styling) that distract from the core skill being demonstrated.
- **Proof Link:** A direct URL to a running instance of the code. Code that does not run is difficult to verify.
- **Context Statement:** A specific section in documentation explaining *why* the solution was built this way.

## What you need

- A GitHub account.
- A code editor (VS Code).
- A terminal.
- A free Vercel or Netlify account (or GitHub Pages).

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Define the scope
**Goal:**
Select a single technical problem to solve. For this lab, the skill is **"Efficient Client-Side Filtering."**

**Actions:**

1.  Create a local folder named `skill-demo-search`.
2.  Create a `README.md` file immediately.
3.  Add the following "Goal Statement" to the top:
    ```markdown
    # Client-Side Search Demo
    **Goal:** Demonstrate performant array filtering on a dataset of 500 records using vanilla JavaScript.
    **Constraint:** No external libraries (no React, no Lodash).
    ```

**Why:**
Defining the constraint upfront prevents over-engineering. Employers want to see that you can solve problems with native tools before reaching for heavy frameworks. Writing the goal first keeps the development focused.

**Verify:**
- Read the README.
- Confirm it lists exactly one goal.
- Confirm it lists exactly one constraint.

**If it fails:**
- **Symptom:** You feel the urge to add a "Login" page.
- **Fix:** Delete the idea. Authentication is a separate skill. Do not mix them.

### Step 2: Build the demo
**Goal:**
Implement the filtering logic in the simplest possible way.

**Actions:**

1.  Create an `index.html` file in your folder.
2.  Paste the following code. This sets up a mock dataset and a search input.
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Skill Proof: Search</title>
        <style>
            body { font-family: system-ui, sans-serif; padding: 20px; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; }
            input { padding: 10px; width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 16px; }
            .item { padding: 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee; }
            .hidden { display: none; }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Employee Directory</h1>
        <input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Type to filter names...">
        <div id="results"></div>

        <script>
            // 1. Generate Mock Data
            const data = Array.from({ length: 500 }, (_, i) => ({
                id: i,
                name: `Employee ${i + 1}`,
                role: i % 3 === 0 ? 'Engineer' : 'Designer'
            }));

            const list = document.getElementById('results');
            const input = document.getElementById('search');

            // 2. Initial Render
            function render(items) {
                list.innerHTML = items.map(i => 
                    `<div class="item"><strong>${i.name}</strong> - ${i.role}</div>`
                ).join('');
            }
            render(data);

            // 3. Filter Logic
            input.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
                const term = e.target.value.toLowerCase();
                const filtered = data.filter(item => 
                    item.name.toLowerCase().includes(term)
                );
                render(filtered);
            });
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser.

**Why:**
This code demonstrates three distinct competencies:
1.  **Data generation:** Creating mock data for testing.
2.  **DOM manipulation:** Updating the UI based on state.
3.  **Event handling:** Reacting to user input in real-time.

**Verify:**
1.  Type "50" into the box.
2.  **Expected:** The list updates to show only employees with "50" in their name (e.g., "Employee 50", "Employee 150").
3.  Delete the text.
4.  **Expected:** The full list returns.

**If it fails:**
- **Symptom:** List vanishes.
- **Fix:** Check the console for syntax errors. Ensure `render` is called inside the event listener.

### Step 3: Deploy the project
**Goal:**
Make the code accessible to anyone with a web browser.

**Actions:**

1.  **Push to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: implement search logic"
    git branch -M main
    # Create a new repo on GitHub and follow the "push an existing repository" instructions
    ```
2.  **Deploy (Vercel Example):**
    - Go to Vercel.com.
    - Click "Add New" > "Project".
    - Import your new GitHub repository.
    - Click "Deploy".
    - Wait for the "Production Deployment" URL.

**Why:**
Code that sits on your hard drive is invisible to recruiters. A live URL proves the code works in a production environment and shows you understand the deployment lifecycle.

**Verify:**
1.  Open the Vercel/Netlify URL on your phone (a different device).
2.  **Expected:** The site loads and the search functions correctly.

**If it fails:**
- **Symptom:** 404 Error.
- **Fix:** Ensure your file is named `index.html`. Most static hosts look for this specific filename by default.

### Step 4: Document the proof
**Goal:**
Explain your work so a recruiter understands the value without reading the code.

**Actions:**

1.  Open `README.md`.
2.  Replace the contents with this structure:
    ```markdown
    # Skill Proof: Client-Side Search

    **Live Demo:** [Insert Vercel URL Here]
    **Source Code:** [Insert GitHub Repo URL Here]

    ## The Goal
    To demonstrate efficient array filtering and DOM updates using vanilla JavaScript, ensuring high performance with a dataset of 500 items.

    ## Technical Choices
    - **Vanilla JS:** Used to avoid the bundle size overhead of React/Vue for a simple list interaction.
    - **Array.filter():** Selected for readability and native browser optimization.
    - **Template Literals:** Used for clean HTML generation within the render function.

    ## How to Run Locally
    1. Clone the repo.
    2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
    ```
3.  Push the changes to GitHub.

**Why:**
The README is the interface between your code and the human hiring manager. It provides context. Explicitly stating *why* you chose Vanilla JS over React shows engineering maturity.

**Verify:**
1.  Go to your GitHub repository page.
2.  Click the "Live Demo" link in your README.
3.  Confirm it opens the deployed site.

**If it fails:**
- **Symptom:** Links are unclickable.
- **Fix:** Ensure you use standard Markdown syntax `[Link Text](URL)`.

## Verify it worked

Perform this final audit before sharing the project:

1.  **Scope Check:** Does the project do exactly one thing (Search)? Yes.
2.  **Functionality Check:** Does the live link work on a mobile device? Yes.
3.  **Documentation Check:** Does the README explain the "Why" and not just the "How"? Yes.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** The project has no README or a default "Create React App" README.
  **Cause:** Neglecting documentation.
  **Fix:** Always replace default READMEs. A generic README suggests a lack of attention to detail.

- **Symptom:** The code works locally but shows a blank page online.
  **Cause:** Case sensitivity issues or incorrect file paths.
  **Fix:** Ensure files are lowercase (e.g., `index.html`, not `Index.html`). Linux servers (used by Vercel/Netlify) are case-sensitive.

- **Symptom:** You spent 4 hours styling the page with CSS.
  **Cause:** Scope creep.
  **Fix:** Use standard browser styles or a classless CSS framework (like Water.css) if you must style it. The goal is to prove the logic, not your design skills.

## Cheat sheet

1.  **Pick:** One specific interaction (Search, Sort, Fetch, Form Validation).
2.  **Build:** Use the simplest tool for the job (often vanilla JS).
3.  **Deploy:** Get a public URL immediately.
4.  **Link:** Put the URL at the very top of the README.

## Next steps

- **Refactor:** Create a version 2 branch that adds a "Debounce" function to the search input to prove performance optimization skills.
- **Test:** Add a simple unit test file to verify the filtering logic.
- **Expand:** Do this again for a different skill, like "API Data Fetching" or "Form State Management."

Small projects are easier to finish and easier to verify.

This post shows how I design a tiny project to prove one skill without fluff.

You will get the steps, a checklist, and common mistakes.

## The promise

You will learn:

- how to pick a tight scope
- how to prove one skill
- how to write honest notes

> "One tight demo beats five vague projects."

## The method

1. Pick one skill.
2. Build one flow.
3. Add one proof link.

### Example summary block

```md
Skill: API fetch
Demo: one page list
Proof: repo and live link
```

## CTA: Open the project list

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Write the skill at the top of your README.
2. Build the smallest demo.
3. Ship and link it.

### Common mistakes

- Picking a multi-feature scope.
- Hiding limits.
- Listing tools you did not use.

## Quick checklist

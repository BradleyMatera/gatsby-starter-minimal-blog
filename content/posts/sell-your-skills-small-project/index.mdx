Small projects are easier to finish and easier to verify.

This post shows a full process for shipping a tiny demo that proves one skill.

You will get steps, checks, and common mistakes.

If you need portfolio proof fast, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a method to prove a single skill with a small demo.

Low level, it is a scope checklist, a build plan, and proof links.

Key terms:

- **Proof demo**: a small project that shows one skill.
- **Scope**: the smallest version of the idea.
- **CTA**: a clear action such as “View demo.”

## What you need

- One skill to prove.
- A small project idea.
- A repo and demo host.

## Start to finish

1) Write the skill at the top of the README.

Why: It keeps the demo focused.

2) Define the smallest demo.

Why: Small scope ships faster.

3) Build one working flow.

Why: A flow is stronger than a list of features.

4) Add proof links.

Why: You need evidence for claims.

### Example summary block

```md
Skill: API fetch
Demo: one page list
Proof: repo + live link
```

## Verify it worked

- The demo runs locally.
- The live link loads.
- The README matches the code.

If you cannot verify it, cut the claim.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Demo never ships.
  **Cause**: Scope too large.
  **Fix**: Cut the feature list in half.

- **Symptom**: Proof link missing.
  **Cause**: Skipping the publish step.
  **Fix**: Add the live link before sharing.

- **Symptom**: Claims feel vague.
  **Cause**: No concrete output.
  **Fix**: Describe the exact flow.

## Cheat sheet

- One skill.
- One flow.
- One proof link.
- One short README.

## Next steps

- Pick one skill and build this week.
- Add proof links after publishing.

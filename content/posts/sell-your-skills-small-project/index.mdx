Small projects are the fastest way to show a skill.

This post shows how to build one demo and document it clearly.

You will ship one feature, add proof links, and write a short case note.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- pick one skill to prove
- build one small demo
- add proof links and a short explanation

> "One clear demo beats a vague resume line."

## What this is

**High level:** A skill proof is a small project that shows one capability.

**Low level:** You build one feature, deploy it, and link the repo.

**Key terms:**

- **Skill proof:** A demo that shows one skill.
- **Proof link:** A repo or live URL.

## What you need

- A repo
- A deploy target
- A short README

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Choose the skill
Goal:
Pick a single skill you can demonstrate quickly.

Actions:
- Write the skill in `README.md`:
  ```text
  Skill to prove: client side search
  ```

Why:
One skill keeps the project focused. It also makes the output easy to judge. This prevents scope creep. You can do another skill later.

Verify:
- The skill is one sentence.
- This confirms the scope is small.

If it fails:
- Symptom: you list five skills.  
  **Fix:** keep only one.

### Step 2: Build the smallest demo
Goal:
Implement the feature in the simplest way.

Actions:
- Build a list and filter it by input.
- Example code:
  ```js
  const filtered = items.filter((i) => i.name.includes(query));
  ```

Why:
The demo should be easy to review. A small example makes the skill obvious. It also reduces bugs. This keeps the project finishable.

Verify:
- Search input filters the list.
- This confirms the feature works.

If it fails:
- Symptom: list does not update.  
  **Fix:** ensure the query state updates on input.

### Step 3: Add proof links
Goal:
Make the demo verifiable.

Actions:
- Add to README:
  ```text
  Repo: https://github.com/yourname/project
  Demo: https://yourname.github.io/project
  ```

Why:
Proof links make the skill real. They also save time for reviewers. This is the most important part of the project. Without proof links, the skill is just a claim.

Verify:
- Click each link.
- Expected: repo and demo load.
- This confirms the proof works.

If it fails:
- Symptom: 404.  
  **Fix:** update the URLs.

## Verify it worked

- The demo shows the skill.
- The proof links open.
- The README states the goal clearly.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** The project proves too many things.  
  **Cause:** scope creep.  
  **Fix:** cut it down to one feature.

- **Symptom:** Proof links are missing.  
  **Cause:** no deploy step.  
  **Fix:** deploy and add links.

- **Symptom:** The skill is unclear.  
  **Cause:** no goal statement.  
  **Fix:** add one sentence to README.

## Cheat sheet

- One skill.
- One demo.
- Two proof links.

## Next steps

- Add a short case study paragraph.
- Add one screenshot of the demo.

## The Job Posts I Targeted

I went after two roles that matched my skills and goals, sourced from Indeed and Greenhouse:

1. **Software Engineer, Web Infrastructure at Anduril Industries**  
   - **Link**: [Greenhouse Job Post](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4663439007?gh_jid=4663439007&gh_src=)  
   - **Requirements**: Bachelor’s in CS or equivalent, 3+ years experience, JavaScript/TypeScript (React, RxJS), cloud infra, Linux, Git, testing, empathy for engineers, U.S. Person status. Preferred: action bias, CI (CircleCI), monorepos (Bazel), Go, gRPC/protobuf.  
   - **Why I Chose It**: Anduril’s defense tech mission resonates with my Army background, and my WebGPU and Docker projects align with their infra focus—I wanted to build tools for engineers like me.  

2. **Software Tester I at Johnson Health Tech**  
   - **Links**: [Indeed Job Post](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Johnson-Health-Tech/jobs?jk=cada0de72ec519fb&start=0&clearPrefilter=1) | [Indeed View](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?from=app-tracker-post_apply-appcard&hl=en&jk=cada0de72ec519fb&tk=1in5ejrch31fj000)  
   - **Requirements**: Bachelor’s in CS/tech field, OOP (C++/Java), Android Studio, Unix scripting, Ubuntu/Windows, Microsoft apps, U.S. work eligibility.  
   - **Why I Chose It**: Testing’s my gateway to engineering—my Jest tests and bug fixes (e.g., Anime CRUD) prove I can ensure quality, and JHT’s fitness tech focus is a cool place to start.  

These jobs popped up in my search, and I tailored everything—like fixing the Anime CRUD Demo link to [https://cruddemo-one.vercel.app/](https://cruddemo-one.vercel.app/)—to nail them.

## SPA Resume Websites: My Live Showcases on CodePen

I built two SPA resume websites on CodePen to flex my skills live—here’s what I created:

### SPA Resume for Anduril Software Engineer
- **What**: A vanilla JS SPA resume on CodePen with PixiJS animation, detailing my journey and projects.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - Nav bar with Home/About, Projects, Skills/Experience, Job Fit, Contact sections.  
  - Featured **WebGPU Shapes Renderer** ([Demo](https://bradleymatera.github.io/leaf-js/)) with “forked and enhanced 2D shape rendering.”  
  - Highlighted **Docker Multilang Project** ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/docker_multilang_project)) for infra skills.  
  - PixiJS canvas for flair, linked to **PixiJS Pong** ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/Pixiejs/tree/main/pixi-pong)).  
- **Why I Did It**: Anduril wants web infra talent—I showcased JavaScript depth, testing (Jest in CheeseMath), and creativity to match their engineer-focused vibe.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: A live SPA on CodePen beats a static resume—it’s interactive proof I can build tools engineers need, hitting their “empathy for engineers” requirement spot-on.  
- **Link**: [Anduril SPA Resume](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/vEYrOGB)  

### SPA Resume for Johnson Health Tech Software Tester
- **What**: A clean SPA resume on CodePen focused on testing projects and navigation.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - Nav with Home/About, Projects, Skills/Experience, Job Fit, Contact.  
  - Showcased **CheeseMath Jest Tests** ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests)) with “wrote Jest tests for math functions.”  
  - Included **Sound Machine** ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dPbVvoa)) with “debugged overlapping sound bugs.”  
  - Job Fit tied to JHT reqs (e.g., Android emulator testing from Anime CRUD).  
- **Why I Did It**: JHT needs testers—I proved I can spot and fix issues with real project examples.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: An SPA on CodePen shows I can build and test web tools—perfect for a testing role—and it’s way more engaging than paper.  
- **Link**: [JHT SPA Resume](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/RNwJPaw)  

**How I Built Them**: I used vanilla JS for SPA navigation, Roboto fonts via Google Fonts, and custom CSS for a sharp, responsive look—hosted them on CodePen to keep it live and accessible.

## Resumes: My Tailored Paper Pitch

I crafted targeted resumes to back up each SPA—here’s what I did:

### Resume for Anduril
- **Focus**: Web infra and JavaScript expertise.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “WebGPU Shapes Renderer: Enhanced 2D rendering with WebGPU” ([Demo](https://bradleymatera.github.io/leaf-js/)).  
  - “Gatsby Blog: Built React site with Netlify deploy” ([Demo](https://bradleysgatsbyblog.netlify.app/)).  
  - Skills: JavaScript, React, Docker, Jest, Git.  
- **Why I Did It**: Anduril needs JS and infra pros—I picked projects like Docker Multilang to show I can handle their stack, even without 3+ years formal experience.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: Highlighting project depth bridged their experience gap, and matching their tech (JS, Git) made it a strong fit.  

### Resume for Johnson Health Tech
- **Focus**: Testing and web dev skills.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “CheeseMath: Wrote Jest tests for math utils” ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests)).  
  - “Anime CRUD App: Tested CRUD ops, fixed refresh bug” ([Demo](https://cruddemo-one.vercel.app/)).  
  - Skills: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Jest, Docker.  
- **Why I Did It**: JHT wants testing—I pulled projects with real debugging (e.g., Sound Machine, Anime CRUD) to prove I’m ready.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: Specific testing wins (e.g., Jest, bug fixes) showed I can jump into their QA role with no lag.  

**Note**: I’ve got these resumes as local files—haven’t uploaded them online yet, but they’re part of my tailored pitch!

## Cover Letters: My Voice, Their Goals

I wrote custom cover letters to give my apps a personal edge—here’s the rundown:

### Cover Letter for Anduril
- **Angle**: Military grit meets web infra passion.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “Anduril’s defense tech mission hits home—I’ve gone from Army medic to building tools like WebGPU Renderer.”  
  - “My Gatsby Blog and Docker projects show I can deliver for engineers—ready to learn TypeScript and Bazel too.”  
  - “Let’s chat about powering your team!”  
- **Why I Did It**: I linked my vet experience to their mission and showed project fit, plus a hunger to grow into their stack.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: It’s personal and technical—hiring managers remember a story that fits their vibe.  

### Cover Letter for Johnson Health Tech
- **Angle**: Testing-ready student with real-world grit.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “I’m applying for Software Tester I because I want to ensure fitness tech works right—my Jest tests in CheeseMath prove I can.”  
  - “Army medic and case manager roles taught me to spot issues; projects like Anime CRUD show I can fix them.”  
  - “Check my portfolio—let’s talk!”  
- **Why I Did It**: I highlighted testing skills and tied my non-tech past to JHT’s QA needs, showing I’m a quick learner.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: It’s honest, specific, and bridges my background to their role—stands out in a stack of apps.  

**Note**: These cover letters are saved locally—I haven’t put them online, but they’re key to my apps!

## Extra CodePens: Bonus Proof

I added extra CodePens to flex more skills:

### For Anduril
- **What**: JavaScript Garbage Collection Tutorial ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzoWpL)).  
- **Why**: Shows JS depth—Anduril values technical know-how.  
- **Why Smart**: A live memory demo proves I understand core concepts they’d care about.  

### For Johnson Health Tech
- **What**: React Calculator ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ogvGZjJ)).  
- **Why**: Shows React and testing—JHT wants tech familiarity.  
- **Why Smart**: A working app with manual testing ties to their QA focus.

## Why This Was a Win

Fixing my Gatsby blog was the foundation—SPAs took it to the next level. Why smart? In 2025, SPA resumes on CodePen ([Anduril SPA](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/vEYrOGB), [JHT SPA](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/RNwJPaw)) show I’m a dev who builds, not just talks. Tailored resumes and cover letters hit job reqs dead-on, and extra CodePens added live cred. It’s a triple threat that screams “hire me”—way better than a generic app.

## Conclusion
I’m pumped about these applications and the journey ahead. I’ll keep you posted on how it goes—fingers crossed for interviews! If you’re job hunting, consider building SPAs and tailoring your apps to stand out. It’s a game-changer in 2025!
Thanks for reading, and happy coding!

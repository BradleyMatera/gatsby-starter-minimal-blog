Job hunting is noisy. I track the parts I can control.

This post is a short system that keeps me honest and focused.

You will get a checklist, a template, and the mistakes I avoid.

## The promise

You will learn:

- what I track each week
- how I reduce wasted effort
- how I keep proof links ready

> "If I cannot prove it in one click, I do not list it."

## What I track

- roles applied
- follow-ups sent
- one proof link per skill

### Example tracking line

```text
Company | Role | Date | Follow-up | Proof link
```

## CTA: Copy the tracker

### Steps

1. Pick a simple tracker.
2. Add one proof link per skill.

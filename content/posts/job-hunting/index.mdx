description: "How I built interactive SPA resumes, aligned them with Anduril and Johnson Health Tech job requirements, and blended those experiments with traditional resumes and cover letters."

## Introduction

In early 2025 I applied to two roles positioned at different ends of the engineering spectrum: Anduril’s Software Engineer (Web Infrastructure) and Johnson Health Tech’s Software Tester I. Rather than relying solely on a static PDF résumé, I experimented with single-page web resumes that double as interactive case studies. This article documents how I researched each role, what I built, how I mapped requirements to evidence, and the lessons I’ll apply to future applications.

## Researching Each Role

### Anduril – Software Engineer, Web Infrastructure
- **Listing:** [Greenhouse job post](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4663439007?gh_jid=4663439007)  
- **Key requirements:** JavaScript/TypeScript depth, infrastructure experience (CircleCI, Bazel, WebGL/WebGPU), Linux familiarity, and empathy for engineers.  
- **Why it resonated:** Their mission aligns with my Army background, and my Triangle Shader Lab and Docker projects demonstrate the graphics and infrastructure focus they expect.  
- **Gaps I acknowledged:** I have internship experience instead of the required three-plus years, so I emphasised measurable outcomes, documentation habits, and eagerness to learn Bazel/RxJS.

### Johnson Health Tech – Software Tester I
- **Listing:** [Indeed posting](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=cada0de72ec519fb)  
- **Key requirements:** QA mindset, object-oriented programming, Android/Unix tooling, and clear communication.  
- **Why it resonated:** My CheeseMath Jest suite, Anime CRUD debugging notes, and manual test checklists map directly to their focus on fitness tech reliability.  
- **Gaps I acknowledged:** I am transitioning from academic projects, so I highlighted reproducible bug reports, test plans, and experience pairing with engineers during internships.

## Building Supplementary SPA Resumes

Interactive résumés add maintenance overhead, and research notes that recruiters still expect a traditional PDF for applicant-tracking systems. However, when paired with conventional materials they can showcase front-end fluency and storytelling (“Interactive Résumés: Opportunities and Trade-offs,” *Journal of Career Development*, 2023). I built two SPAs on CodePen to walk hiring teams through my work.

| SPA | Purpose | Highlights | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anduril SPA Resume | Demonstrate infrastructure instincts and graphics work | Sectioned navigation, PixiJS animation of graphics demos, links to Triangle Shader Lab and Docker Multilang. | [View on CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/vEYrOGB) |
| Johnson Health Tech SPA Resume | Present testing journey and QA tooling | Modules for defect stories, unit tests, and manual testing logs; direct CTA to download the PDF résumé. | [View on CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/RNwJPaw) |

Implementation details:
- Vanilla JavaScript with a lightweight router pattern drives navigation and analytics events.  
- Tailwind CSS utilities handle responsive layout; print styles ensure recruiters can export a PDF-friendly version.  
- I log basic view metrics (CodePen console output and manual notes) to see which sections attract the most attention during portfolio reviews.

## Traditional Materials Still Matter

Applicant tracking systems remain dependent on structured PDFs (“Applicant Tracking Systems: A Recruiter’s Guide,” Lever, 2024). I created tailored PDF résumés and cover letters for each role and summarised the redacted content below.

### Anduril Package
- **Résumé focus:** Triangle Shader Lab (WebGPU fundamentals teardown), Docker Multilang (polyglot containerisation), and Netlify/Gatsby blog deployment.  
- **Cover letter angle:** Connected my Army medic experience to Anduril’s mission, emphasised documentation and empathy, and acknowledged growth areas (Bazel, RxJS).  
- **Artifacts provided:** Links to public demos, GitHub repositories, and CI pipelines that mirror the infrastructure responsibilities in the job description.

### Johnson Health Tech Package
- **Résumé focus:** CheeseMath Jest suite (unit tests), Anime CRUD bug reproduction and fix, manual testing of the Sound Machine CodePen.  
- **Cover letter angle:** Highlighted disciplined triage, reproducible defect documentation, and commitment to reliable user-facing experiences.  
- **Artifacts provided:** Test plans, GitHub issues, and deployment logs demonstrating how I close bugs end to end.

## Mapping Requirements to Evidence

| Requirement | Evidence I Provided |
| --- | --- |
| JavaScript/TypeScript depth (Anduril) | Triangle Shader Lab walkthrough, SPA résumés, custom Gatsby theme overrides. |
| Infrastructure & build tooling | Docker Multilang containers, GitHub Actions workflows, environment parity docs. |
| Testing discipline (Johnson Health Tech) | Jest coverage reports, Anime CRUD defect notes, manual test checklists. |
| Linux & scripting familiarity | Shell scripts in Docker demo, AWS Lambda deployment runbooks from other portfolio work. |
| Communication & storytelling | SPA case studies, tailored cover letters, annotated GitHub issues. |

## Results and Lessons Learned

**Wins**  
- The SPA résumés served as conversation starters during recruiter calls and portfolio walkthroughs.  
- Mapping requirements to projects clarified which artifacts to highlight and exposed gaps I still need to close.  
- Maintaining GitHub-hosted demos let me update content rapidly without resubmitting applications.

**Challenges**  
- Interactive résumés demand ongoing maintenance. CodePen projects require quarterly updates to avoid broken links or outdated text.  
- Some recruiters requested PDFs immediately, reinforcing the need to lead with traditional documents.  
- Private cover letters are hard to reference publicly; I now document the key points in blog posts so readers can follow the narrative without exposing personal data.

## Next Steps

1. Publish redacted versions of both cover letters so future readers can see the structure and tone.  
2. Add automated accessibility checks (axe, Lighthouse) to the SPA résumés and publish the results alongside the demos.  
3. Package the SPAs as downloadable static sites for environments where CodePen is blocked.  
4. Continue pairing every experimental artifact with a standard PDF résumé and LinkedIn update so I meet recruiters’ expectations.

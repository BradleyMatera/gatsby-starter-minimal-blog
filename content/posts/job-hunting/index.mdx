description: "How I built role-specific SPA résumés for Anduril + Johnson Health Tech, the evidence I paired with each, and what recruiters said."
theme: "Career"
---

> **Context:** Early-career dev (no paid SWE role yet) documenting my job search. Two target roles: Anduril (Web Infrastructure) and Johnson Health Tech (Software Tester I).  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped organize research notes and recruiter feedback; the PDFs/SPAs themselves are hand-built (with AI-disclosure sections).  
> **Status:** Applications submitted, interviews held, no offers yet. Sharing the process keeps me accountable.

## Reality snapshot

- Every application still starts with a PDF résumé uploaded to the ATS.  
- SPA résumés live on CodePen (exported to static builds when needed). They contain honesty blocks, GitHub links, and the same PDF download.  
- Recruiters care most about clarity + proof, not animations. The SPAs help when I’m in conversations, not before.

## Target roles & requirement mapping

| Company / Role | Key requirements | My evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anduril – Software Engineer, Web Infrastructure | JS/TS depth, WebGPU familiarity, DevOps toolchain (CircleCI/Bazel), Linux comfort, clear communication | Triangle Shader Lab (WebGPU study), Docker Multilang project, GitHub Actions write-ups, AWS internship runbooks, Army medic story for calm communication |
| Johnson Health Tech – Software Tester I | QA mindset, OOP fundamentals, Android/Unix fluency, documentation | CheeseMath Jest suite, Anime CRUD bug diary, manual test checklists, shell scripts from AWS labs |

Listings: [Anduril](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4663439007?gh_jid=4663439007) • [Johnson Health Tech](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=cada0de72ec519fb)

## SPA résumé structure

- **Hero:** Name, role target, PDF download, “Reality” note (“Early-career developer; demos listed below are personal projects”).  
- **Sections:** Skills, project highlights, proof links (GitHub PRs, Render demos), honesty log snapshot.  
- **Analytics:** Console logs + manual tracking (time on page, which sections recruiters mention). If multiple recruiters miss a section, I move it.  
- **Accessibility:** Same rules as my main portfolio—skip links, keyboard nav, alt text.

### Example – Anduril SPA résumé

- Built with vanilla JS + Tailwind + PixiJS accents referencing the Triangle Shader Lab study.  
- Links to: Triangle Shader Lab (WebGPU study notes), Docker Multilang repo, AWS internship runbooks, medic-to-engineer blog post.  
- Includes a “Reality snapshot” card: “Render backend cold-starts ~5 minutes, AWS experience is lab-only, Bazel knowledge TBD.”

### Example – Johnson Health Tech SPA résumé

- Focus on test plans, Jest coverage, defect narratives.  
- Screenshots from CheeseMath (live demo) and Anime CRUD bug logs.  
- CTA buttons for PDF download + GitHub issues showing actual QA work.  
- CodePen link: [https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/RNwJPaw](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/RNwJPaw)

## Traditional materials still lead

- **PDF résumé:** 1 page, metric-driven, ATS-friendly. Updated monthly; stored in `/static/BradleyMatera-Resume.pdf`.  
- **Cover letters:** Tailored to each company. I cite specific requirements + evidence, then link to the SPA for the curious.  
- **Evidence bundle:** When possible I include a GitHub issue, PR, or demo link that matches each requirement. Recruiters responded positively to “here’s the proof” sections.

## Recruiter feedback & adjustments

- “Love the honesty blocks, but send the PDF first.” → PDF now highlighted at the top of every page.  
- “Triangle Shader Lab sounds like a product.” → Updated copy everywhere to call it a WebGPU study site.  
- “Hard to find your contact info.” → Added header/footer CTAs + `/contact` link in every hero.  
- “Can you share cover letter templates?” → I now keep redacted versions and plan to publish snippets once sensitive data is removed.

## Results (so far)

- SPA résumés sparked deeper conversations (“Walk me through your Docker project” instead of “Where’s your GitHub?”).  
- Requirement-to-evidence mapping made interviews smoother; I always had a repo or log to show.  
- Maintenance cost is real: I audit each SPA quarterly for accessibility + copy accuracy. When life gets busy, I freeze them and stick to the PDF.

## Next steps

1. Publish sanitized cover letter templates.  
2. Automate accessibility audits for the SPAs (axe via GitHub Actions).  
3. Package each SPA as a static download for companies that block CodePen.  
4. Keep pairing every new artifact (blog post, project) with a requirement so I’m ready for the next role.

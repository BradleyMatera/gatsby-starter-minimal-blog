description: "How I built role-specific SPA résumés for Anduril + Johnson Health Tech, the evidence I paired with each, and what recruiters said."
theme: "Career"
---

> **Context:** Early-career dev (no paid SWE role yet) documenting my job search. Two target roles: Anduril (Web Infrastructure) and Johnson Health Tech (Software Tester I).  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped organize research notes and recruiter feedback; the PDFs/SPAs themselves are hand-built (with AI-disclosure sections).  
> **Status:** Applications submitted, interviews held, no offers yet. Sharing the process keeps me accountable.

## Reality snapshot

- Every application still starts with a PDF résumé uploaded to the ATS.  
- SPA résumés live on CodePen (exported to static builds when needed). They contain honesty blocks, GitHub links, and the same PDF download.  
- Recruiters care most about clarity + proof, not animations. The SPAs help when I’m in conversations, not before.
- Versioning: I bump copy versions weekly during active hunts and log changes in a Notion page (what changed, why, recruiter reaction).  
- Metrics tracked: time-on-page, which sections get mentioned in calls, click-through on PDF/download/LinkedIn. Most traction still comes from PDF → LinkedIn → GitHub, but SPAs improve depth when the recruiter actually looks.

## Why I bothered with SPA résumés

- **Control the story:** ATS strips formatting; the SPA lets me foreground “proof-first” links and honesty blocks.  
- **Speed of iteration:** CodePen + Tailwind means I can ship a role-specific version in under a day without breaking the main portfolio.  
- **Honesty front and center:** Each SPA has a “Reality” card (what’s real, what’s not, AI disclosure). It disarms skepticism when I’m early-career.  
- **Live demos embedded:** Recruiters who do click can see GIFs/screenshots/code links without digging.

## Constraints and rules I follow

- PDF first, always. SPA is additive, never a replacement.  
- One SPA per role; once the role closes, I archive the pen and keep the PDF + lessons.  
- Copy must include AI disclosure and “not a product” for study demos.  
- Accessibility parity: skip links, keyboard traps avoided, alt text on every image, prefers-reduced-motion respected.  
- No autoplay media; performance budget under 90kb CSS/JS where possible.

## Target roles & requirement mapping

| Company / Role | Key requirements | My evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anduril – Software Engineer, Web Infrastructure | JS/TS depth, WebGPU familiarity, DevOps toolchain (CircleCI/Bazel), Linux comfort, clear communication | Triangle Shader Lab (WebGPU study), Docker Multilang project, GitHub Actions write-ups, AWS internship runbooks, Army medic story for calm communication |
| Johnson Health Tech – Software Tester I | QA mindset, OOP fundamentals, Android/Unix fluency, documentation | CheeseMath Jest suite, Anime CRUD bug diary, manual test checklists, shell scripts from AWS labs |

Listings: [Anduril](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4663439007?gh_jid=4663439007) • [Johnson Health Tech](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=cada0de72ec519fb)

### Requirement-to-proof detail (Anduril)

- **WebGPU familiarity:** Triangle Shader Lab write-up, code links, and honesty note (“study site, not production”).  
- **DevOps/tooling:** Docker Multilang project README (health checks, logs, failure drills), GitHub Actions pipelines on multiple repos, notes on OIDC runners.  
- **Linux comfort:** AWS internship runbooks + shell scripts for log inspection; link to service-restart drills.  
- **Communication under pressure:** 82nd Airborne medic → calm debugging story; links to incident-style blog notes.

### Requirement-to-proof detail (Johnson Health Tech)

- **QA mindset:** Anime CRUD bug diary (defect, repro, fix); Jest coverage on CheeseMath; manual test checklists.  
- **OOP fundamentals:** Small class-based utilities in Anime CRUD; notes on refactoring for testability.  
- **Android/Unix fluency:** Bash scripts for log tailing and cleanup; adb basics noted in cover letter.  
- **Documentation:** README sections with “Reality” + TODO; short runbooks included in the SPA.

## SPA résumé structure

- **Hero:** Name, role target, PDF download, “Reality” note (“Early-career developer; demos listed below are personal projects”).  
- **Sections:** Skills, project highlights, proof links (GitHub PRs, Render demos), honesty log snapshot.  
- **Analytics:** Console logs + manual tracking (time on page, which sections recruiters mention). If multiple recruiters miss a section, I move it.  
- **Accessibility:** Same rules as my main portfolio—skip links, keyboard nav, alt text.
- **Performance:** Inline critical CSS; defer any non-critical JS; images compressed; no third-party trackers.  
- **AI disclosure:** A dedicated paragraph stating where AI assisted (copy scaffolding, regex snippets) and what I rewrote by hand.

### Example – Anduril SPA résumé

- Built with vanilla JS + Tailwind + PixiJS accents referencing the Triangle Shader Lab study.  
- Links to: Triangle Shader Lab (WebGPU study notes), Docker Multilang repo, AWS internship runbooks, medic-to-engineer blog post.  
- Includes a “Reality snapshot” card: “Render backend cold-starts ~5 minutes, AWS experience is lab-only, Bazel knowledge TBD.”  
- CodePen link: [https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/vEYrOGB](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/vEYrOGB)

### Example – Johnson Health Tech SPA résumé

- Focus on test plans, Jest coverage, defect narratives.  
- Screenshots from CheeseMath (live demo) and Anime CRUD bug logs.  
- CTA buttons for PDF download + GitHub issues showing actual QA work.  
- CodePen link: [https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/RNwJPaw](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/RNwJPaw)

### Cover letter pattern I’m using

- **Opening:** Cite the role and 1–2 requirements verbatim from the listing.  
- **Evidence block:** Bullet each requirement with a matching artifact (repo, bug diary, runbook).  
- **Reality note:** “Early-career; experience is project/internship-level; seeking mentorship.”  
- **CTA:** Link to PDF + SPA; offer a 15-minute walkthrough.  
- **Sanitization:** Redact company specifics before publishing templates.

## Traditional materials still lead

- **PDF résumé:** 1 page, metric-driven, ATS-friendly. Updated monthly; stored in `/static/BradleyMatera-Resume.pdf`.  
- **Cover letters:** Tailored to each company. I cite specific requirements + evidence, then link to the SPA for the curious.  
- **Evidence bundle:** When possible I include a GitHub issue, PR, or demo link that matches each requirement. Recruiters responded positively to “here’s the proof” sections.

## Recruiter feedback & adjustments

- “Love the honesty blocks, but send the PDF first.” → PDF now highlighted at the top of every page.  
- “Triangle Shader Lab sounds like a product.” → Updated copy everywhere to call it a WebGPU study site.  
- “Hard to find your contact info.” → Added header/footer CTAs + `/contact` link in every hero.  
- “Can you share cover letter templates?” → I now keep redacted versions and plan to publish snippets once sensitive data is removed.
- “Where is your test evidence?” → Added direct links to test reports (Jest output) and bug diaries instead of burying them in copy.  
- “Loading feels slow.” → Reduced JS/CSS bundle, lazy-loaded screenshots, and added a fallback static export for slow networks.  
- “What’s real vs aspirational?” → Expanded honesty blocks with dates, scope, and TODOs per project.

## Results (so far)

- SPA résumés sparked deeper conversations (“Walk me through your Docker project” instead of “Where’s your GitHub?”).  
- Requirement-to-evidence mapping made interviews smoother; I always had a repo or log to show.  
- Maintenance cost is real: I audit each SPA quarterly for accessibility + copy accuracy. When life gets busy, I freeze them and stick to the PDF.

## Build pipeline for the SPAs

- **Authoring:** CodePen for rapid edits; Tailwind for consistent tokens; inline honesty blocks.  
- **Testing:** Manual keyboard walk-through, Axe browser extension, lighthouse checks targeting 90+ for accessibility/perf.  
- **Export:** CodePen export → static build; optional Netlify deploy for private preview links.  
- **Analytics:** Simple console logs + verbal feedback tracking; no external trackers to avoid privacy/legal friction with recruiters.  
- **Version control:** Changelogs in Notion with date, change, and recruiter feedback for that change.

## Risks and mitigations

- **Recruiters skipping the SPA:** Mitigation—PDF-first workflow and inline PDF download CTA on the SPA.  
- **Content drift:** Mitigation—quarterly audits; archive old role-specific claims; date-stamp honesty blocks.  
- **Accessibility regressions:** Mitigation—Axe checks, manual keyboard tab pass, prefers-reduced-motion toggle.  
- **Perception risk (“too flashy”):** Mitigation—minimal animation, focus on proof links, plain copy.

## Lessons learned

- Proof beats polish: links to real repos/bug diaries open doors faster than fancy visuals.  
- Specificity wins: mirroring exact requirements and pairing them with artifacts reduces back-and-forth.  
- Honesty upfront disarms skepticism: “lab-only AWS” or “study site” language earns trust.  
- Maintenance is a tax: SPAs require grooming; freezing them when busy prevents stale claims.

## Next steps

1. Publish sanitized cover letter templates.  
2. Automate accessibility audits for the SPAs (axe via GitHub Actions).  
3. Package each SPA as a static download for companies that block CodePen.  
4. Keep pairing every new artifact (blog post, project) with a requirement so I’m ready for the next role.

Job hunting is chaotic unless you make it a repeatable process.

This post shows the exact workflow I use to track applications and improve the resume.

You will create a tracker, a resume folder, and a short feedback loop.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- create a simple application tracker
- organize resume versions in a clear folder
- run a weekly feedback review

> "If you cannot see your pipeline, you cannot fix it."

## What this is

**High level:** A job search is a pipeline of applications, follow ups, and improvements.

**Low level:** You track each application, store each resume version, and review results weekly.

**Key terms:**

- **Tracker:** A file that records applications and outcomes.
- **Resume version:** A tailored copy of your resume for one role.
- **Feedback loop:** A short review to change what is not working.

## What you need

- A folder for job search files
- A spreadsheet or CSV file
- A calendar reminder

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create a tracker
Goal:
Build a single file that tracks every application.

Actions:
- File path: `job-search/tracker.csv`
- Add headers:
  ```text
  company,role,date_applied,status,link,notes
  ```
- Command:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p job-search
  $EDITOR job-search/tracker.csv
  ```

Why:
A tracker makes your search visible. It stops you from forgetting who you applied to. It also shows patterns in rejections and responses. Without a tracker, you repeat mistakes.

Verify:
- Open the file and add one real application row.
- Expected: one line with real data.
- This confirms the tracker is live.

If it fails:
- Symptom: you never update the file.
- Fix: set a weekly reminder and add one row at a time.

### Step 2: Store resume versions
Goal:
Keep each resume version tied to a role.

Actions:
- File path: `job-search/resumes/`
- Create one file per role:
  ```text
  job-search/resumes/2025-02-20_company_role.pdf
  ```

Why:
Tailored resumes are easier to manage when stored with a naming pattern. It also lets you review what you sent later. This prevents conflicting versions. You can compare outcomes against each version.

Verify:
- Ensure at least one PDF exists in the folder.
- Expected: file names include date and company.
- This confirms the structure is consistent.

If it fails:
- Symptom: files are scattered.
- Fix: move them into the folder and rename them once.

### Step 3: Add a weekly review note
Goal:
Record what is working and what is not.

Actions:
- File path: `job-search/weekly-notes.md`
- Add a template:
  ```text
  Week of:
  - Applied:
  - Interviews:
  - Rejections:
  - Change next week:
  ```

Why:
A weekly note creates a feedback loop. It forces you to adjust your approach. It also keeps you from repeating the same week. One note per week is enough.

Verify:
- Fill in the template for the current week.
- This confirms the loop is active.

If it fails:
- Symptom: the note stays empty.
- Fix: add just one line and keep going.

## Verify it worked

- The tracker has real entries.
- Resume versions are stored and named.
- Weekly notes are filled in.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** You forget where you applied.  
  **Cause:** No tracker.  
  **Fix:** add every application on the same day.

- **Symptom:** Resume versions get mixed.  
  **Cause:** No naming pattern.  
  **Fix:** add date and company to the file name.

- **Symptom:** You keep applying without feedback.  
  **Cause:** No weekly review.  
  **Fix:** write one change per week.

## Cheat sheet

- One tracker file.
- One resume folder.
- One weekly note.

## Next steps

- Add a short list of target companies.
- Add a follow up reminder in your calendar.

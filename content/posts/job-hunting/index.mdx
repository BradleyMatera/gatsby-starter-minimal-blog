Job hunting gets chaotic fast if you do not track proof.

This post is a complete workflow I use to keep the process honest and focused.

You will get the steps, the checks, and the common mistakes.

If you are applying right now, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a job search system that prioritizes proof and clarity.

Low level, it is a tracker, a weekly review, and a proof link checklist.

Key terms:

- **Proof link**: a repo or demo URL that backs a claim.
- **Tracker**: a simple list of applications and follow-ups.
- **Weekly review**: a short check to drop weak leads.

## What you need

- A basic spreadsheet or note.
- A list of target roles.
- One proof link per skill.

## Start to finish

1) Create a tracker.

Why: You need a single source of truth.

Example columns:

```text
Company | Role | Date | Follow-up | Proof link
```

2) Pick a small target list.

Why: Broad lists waste time.

3) Attach proof links to each skill.

Why: Claims without proof are weak.

4) Do a weekly review.

Why: You need to cut low-quality targets.

5) Update the tracker after each action.

Why: Accurate notes prevent repeated work.

## Verify it worked

- You can open the tracker and see the next action.
- Each skill in your resume has a proof link.
- You removed at least one weak target this week.

If the tracker is messy, simplify it.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Too many applications, no replies.
  **Cause**: Applying without targeting.
  **Fix**: Cut the list and improve proof.

- **Symptom**: Resume looks strong but projects are weak.
  **Cause**: No proof links.
  **Fix**: Add one working demo per claim.

- **Symptom**: No follow-ups.
  **Cause**: No review cadence.
  **Fix**: Add a weekly review block.

## Cheat sheet

- One tracker.
- One proof link per skill.
- Weekly review.
- Drop weak targets.

## Next steps

- Tighten your proof links today.
- Remove one claim you cannot prove.
- Follow up on two strong roles.

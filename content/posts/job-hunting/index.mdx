## 🌟 The Job Posts I Targeted

I went after two roles that matched my skills and goals, sourced from Indeed and Greenhouse:

1. **Software Engineer, Web Infrastructure at Anduril Industries**  
   - **Link**: [Greenhouse Job Post](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4663439007?gh_jid=4663439007&gh_src=)  
   - **Requirements**: Bachelor’s in CS or equivalent, 3+ years experience, JavaScript/TypeScript (React, RxJS), cloud infra, Linux, Git, testing, empathy for engineers, U.S. Person status. Preferred: action bias, CI (CircleCI), monorepos (Bazel), Go, gRPC/protobuf.  
   - **Why I Chose It**: Anduril’s defense tech mission resonates with my Army background, and my WebGPU and Docker projects align with their infra focus—I wanted to build tools for engineers like me.  

2. **Software Tester I at Johnson Health Tech**  
   - **Links**: [Indeed Job Post](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Johnson-Health-Tech/jobs?jk=cada0de72ec519fb&start=0&clearPrefilter=1) | [Indeed View](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?from=app-tracker-post_apply-appcard&hl=en&jk=cada0de72ec519fb&tk=1in5ejrch31fj000)  
   - **Requirements**: Bachelor’s in CS/tech field, OOP (C++/Java), Android Studio, Unix scripting, Ubuntu/Windows, Microsoft apps, U.S. work eligibility.  
   - **Why I Chose It**: Testing’s my gateway to engineering—my Jest tests and bug fixes (e.g., Anime CRUD) prove I can ensure quality, and JHT’s fitness tech focus is a cool place to start.  

These jobs popped up in my search, and I tailored everything—like fixing the Anime CRUD Demo link to [https://cruddemo-one.vercel.app/](https://cruddemo-one.vercel.app/)—to nail them.

## 💻 SPA Resume Websites: My Live Showcases on CodePen

I built two SPA resume websites on CodePen to flex my skills live—here’s what I created:

### SPA Resume for Anduril Software Engineer
- **What**: A vanilla JS SPA resume on CodePen with PixiJS animation, detailing my journey and projects.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - Nav bar with Home/About, Projects, Skills/Experience, Job Fit, Contact sections.  
  - Featured **WebGPU Shapes Renderer** ([Demo](https://bradleymatera.github.io/leaf-js/)) with “forked and enhanced 2D shape rendering.”  
  - Highlighted **Docker Multilang Project** ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/docker_multilang_project)) for infra skills.  
  - PixiJS canvas for flair, linked to **PixiJS Pong** ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/Pixiejs/tree/main/pixi-pong)).  
- **Why I Did It**: Anduril wants web infra talent—I showcased JavaScript depth, testing (Jest in CheeseMath), and creativity to match their engineer-focused vibe.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: A live SPA on CodePen beats a static resume—it’s interactive proof I can build tools engineers need, hitting their “empathy for engineers” requirement spot-on.  
- **Link**: [Anduril SPA Resume](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/vEYrOGB)  

### SPA Resume for Johnson Health Tech Software Tester
- **What**: A clean SPA resume on CodePen focused on testing projects and navigation.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - Nav with Home/About, Projects, Skills/Experience, Job Fit, Contact.  
  - Showcased **CheeseMath Jest Tests** ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests)) with “wrote Jest tests for math functions.”  
  - Included **Sound Machine** ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dPbVvoa)) with “debugged overlapping sound bugs.”  
  - Job Fit tied to JHT reqs (e.g., Android emulator testing from Anime CRUD).  
- **Why I Did It**: JHT needs testers—I proved I can spot and fix issues with real project examples.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: An SPA on CodePen shows I can build and test web tools—perfect for a testing role—and it’s way more engaging than paper.  
- **Link**: [JHT SPA Resume](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/RNwJPaw)  

**How I Built Them**: I used vanilla JS for SPA navigation, Roboto fonts via Google Fonts, and custom CSS for a sharp, responsive look—hosted them on CodePen to keep it live and accessible.

## 📄 Resumes: My Tailored Paper Pitch

I crafted targeted resumes to back up each SPA—here’s what I did:

### Resume for Anduril
- **Focus**: Web infra and JavaScript expertise.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “WebGPU Shapes Renderer: Enhanced 2D rendering with WebGPU” ([Demo](https://bradleymatera.github.io/leaf-js/)).  
  - “Gatsby Blog: Built React site with Netlify deploy” ([Demo](https://bradleysgatsbyblog.netlify.app/)).  
  - Skills: JavaScript, React, Docker, Jest, Git.  
- **Why I Did It**: Anduril needs JS and infra pros—I picked projects like Docker Multilang to show I can handle their stack, even without 3+ years formal experience.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: Highlighting project depth bridged their experience gap, and matching their tech (JS, Git) made it a strong fit.  

### Resume for Johnson Health Tech
- **Focus**: Testing and web dev skills.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “CheeseMath: Wrote Jest tests for math utils” ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests)).  
  - “Anime CRUD App: Tested CRUD ops, fixed refresh bug” ([Demo](https://cruddemo-one.vercel.app/)).  
  - Skills: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Jest, Docker.  
- **Why I Did It**: JHT wants testing—I pulled projects with real debugging (e.g., Sound Machine, Anime CRUD) to prove I’m ready.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: Specific testing wins (e.g., Jest, bug fixes) showed I can jump into their QA role with no lag.  

**Note**: I’ve got these resumes as local files—haven’t uploaded them online yet, but they’re part of my tailored pitch!

## ✍️ Cover Letters: My Voice, Their Goals

I wrote custom cover letters to give my apps a personal edge—here’s the rundown:

### Cover Letter for Anduril
- **Angle**: Military grit meets web infra passion.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “Anduril’s defense tech mission hits home—I’ve gone from Army medic to building tools like WebGPU Renderer.”  
  - “My Gatsby Blog and Docker projects show I can deliver for engineers—ready to learn TypeScript and Bazel too.”  
  - “Let’s chat about powering your team!”  
- **Why I Did It**: I linked my vet experience to their mission and showed project fit, plus a hunger to grow into their stack.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: It’s personal and technical—hiring managers remember a story that fits their vibe.  

### Cover Letter for Johnson Health Tech
- **Angle**: Testing-ready student with real-world grit.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “I’m applying for Software Tester I because I want to ensure fitness tech works right—my Jest tests in CheeseMath prove I can.”  
  - “Army medic and case manager roles taught me to spot issues; projects like Anime CRUD show I can fix them.”  
  - “Check my portfolio—let’s talk!”  
- **Why I Did It**: I highlighted testing skills and tied my non-tech past to JHT’s QA needs, showing I’m a quick learner.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: It’s honest, specific, and bridges my background to their role—stands out in a stack of apps.  

**Note**: These cover letters are saved locally—I haven’t put them online, but they’re key to my apps!

## 💻 Extra CodePens: Bonus Proof

I added extra CodePens to flex more skills:

### For Anduril
- **What**: JavaScript Garbage Collection Tutorial ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzoWpL)).  
- **Why**: Shows JS depth—Anduril values technical know-how.  
- **Why Smart**: A live memory demo proves I understand core concepts they’d care about.  

### For Johnson Health Tech
- **What**: React Calculator ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ogvGZjJ)).  
- **Why**: Shows React and testing—JHT wants tech familiarity.  
- **Why Smart**: A working app with manual testing ties to their QA focus.

## 🌍 Why This Was a Win

Fixing my Gatsby blog was the foundation—SPAs took it to the next level. Why smart? In 2025, SPA resumes on CodePen ([Anduril SPA](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/vEYrOGB), [JHT SPA](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/RNwJPaw)) show I’m a dev who builds, not just talks. Tailored resumes and cover letters hit job reqs dead-on, and extra CodePens added live cred. It’s a triple threat that screams “hire me”—way better than a generic app.

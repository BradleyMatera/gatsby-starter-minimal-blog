  <p class="content-paragraph">
    As a student nearing the completion of my web development degree at Full Sail University, I've embarked on the challenging yet exciting journey of job hunting in the tech industry. This post details my experiences, strategies, and lessons learned while seeking a role that aligns with my skills and passions.

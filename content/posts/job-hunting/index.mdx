> **Context:** Documenting how I, an early-career developer with zero paid SWE roles so far, target applications for companies like Anduril and Johnson Health Tech.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped outline this article; I edited it on 2025-10-15 with my actual application tracker.  
> **Status:** Lessons learned from real submissions + recruiter feedback—no job offer yet, but this keeps me accountable.

## TL;DR

- **Targeted applications beat generic blasts.** I built role-specific SPA résumés plus traditional PDFs for Anduril and Johnson Health Tech.  
- **Research drives artifacts.** Each requirement mapped to a project, demo, or document proving the skill.  
- **Interactivity complements, not replaces, PDFs.** Recruiters still asked for formatted résumés immediately.  
- **Maintenance matters.** Interactive assets require ongoing updates, analytics, and accessibility checks.

## Roles Targeted

- **Anduril – Software Engineer, Web Infrastructure**  
	- Requirements: JavaScript/TypeScript depth, infrastructure tooling (CircleCI, Bazel), graphics/WebGPU, Linux comfort, empathetic communication.  
	- Resonance: Army background aligns with mission; my small WebGPU study site (Triangle Shader Lab) plus Docker projects show I’m comfortable learning graphics + infra concepts hands-on.  
	- Gaps: Industry tenure (internship vs 3+ years) → highlighted documentation habits and willingness to ramp on Bazel/RxJS.

- **Johnson Health Tech – Software Tester I**  
	- Requirements: QA mindset, OOP fundamentals, Android/Unix fluency, communication.  
	- Resonance: CheeseMath Jest suite, Anime CRUD debugging docs, and manual testing logs align with reliability focus.  
	- Gaps: Transitioning from academia → emphasised reproducible bug reports and collaboration during internships.

## Researching Each Role

### Anduril – Software Engineer, Web Infrastructure
- **Listing:** [Greenhouse job post](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4663439007?gh_jid=4663439007)  
- **Key requirements:** JavaScript/TypeScript depth, infrastructure experience (CircleCI, Bazel, WebGL/WebGPU), Linux familiarity, and empathy for engineers.  
- **Why it resonated:** Their mission aligns with my Army background, and referencing Triangle Shader Lab as a WebGPU study (not a framework) plus Docker Multilang showed I’m willing to dig into graphics + DevOps basics honestly.  
- **Gaps I acknowledged:** I have internship experience instead of the required three-plus years, so I emphasised measurable outcomes, documentation habits, and eagerness to learn Bazel/RxJS.

### Johnson Health Tech – Software Tester I
- **Listing:** [Indeed posting](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=cada0de72ec519fb)  
- **Key requirements:** QA mindset, object-oriented programming, Android/Unix tooling, and clear communication.  
- **Why it resonated:** My CheeseMath Jest suite, Anime CRUD debugging notes, and manual test checklists map directly to their focus on fitness tech reliability.  
- **Gaps I acknowledged:** I am transitioning from academic projects, so I highlighted reproducible bug reports, test plans, and experience pairing with engineers during internships.

## Building Supplementary SPA Resumes

- **Anduril SPA résumé:** Infrastructure-focused navigation, PixiJS animations referencing the Triangle Shader Lab study site and Docker Multilang repo, plus clear links back to the canonical demos. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/vEYrOGB)  
- **Johnson Health Tech SPA résumé:** Modules for defect stories, unit tests, manual testing logs, and a prominent PDF download CTA. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/RNwJPaw)

Implementation notes: Vanilla JS with a lightweight router, Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts + print styles, and simple analytics (console logs/manual notes) to monitor section engagement. Research confirms recruiters still expect PDFs for ATS compatibility (“Interactive Résumés: Opportunities and Trade-offs,” *Journal of Career Development*, 2023).

## Traditional Materials Still Matter

- **Anduril package:** Résumé spotlighted the Triangle Shader Lab study, Docker Multilang, and Netlify/Gatsby deployments; cover letter tied Army medic experience to Anduril’s mission and outlined growth plans for Bazel/RxJS; artifacts included public demos, GitHub links, and CI pipelines.  
- **Johnson Health Tech package:** Résumé emphasised CheeseMath Jest suite, Anime CRUD bug fixes, and manual testing notes; cover letter stressed disciplined triage and documentation; artifacts included test plans, GitHub issues, and deploy logs.

Applicant tracking systems remain PDF-centric (Lever, “Applicant Tracking Systems: A Recruiter’s Guide,” 2024), so traditional documents ship with every application.

## Mapping Requirements to Evidence

- **JavaScript/TypeScript depth:** Triangle Shader Lab write-ups (framed as a study, not a product), SPA résumés, custom Gatsby theme overrides.  
- **Infrastructure & tooling:** Docker Multilang containers, GitHub Actions workflows, environment parity documentation.  
- **Testing discipline:** Jest coverage reports, Anime CRUD defect narratives, manual checklists.  
- **Linux & scripting:** Shell scripts embedded in Docker demos, AWS Lambda runbooks.  
- **Communication & storytelling:** SPA case studies, tailored cover letters, annotated GitHub issues.

## Results & Lessons Learned

**Wins**  
- SPA résumés sparked richer recruiter conversations and portfolio walkthroughs.  
- Requirement-to-evidence mapping clarified which artifacts to foreground and where skills were thin.  
- Hosting demos on GitHub enabled rapid updates without resubmitting applications.

**Challenges**  
- Interactive résumés require quarterly upkeep to avoid stale copy or broken embeds.  
- Many recruiters immediately asked for PDFs, reinforcing that interactivity is supplementary.  
- Private cover letters are hard to share publicly; I now capture key themes in blog posts without exposing sensitive details.

## Next Steps

1. Publish redacted cover letter templates to guide future candidates.  
2. Add automated accessibility audits (axe, Lighthouse) to SPA résumés and share results.  
3. Bundle SPAs as downloadable static sites for environments where CodePen is blocked.  
4. Continue pairing every experimental artifact with a canonical PDF résumé and LinkedIn update.

## Key Takeaways

- **Lead with clarity, support with creativity.** PDFs satisfy ATS requirements; SPAs provide narrative depth.  
- **Evidence beats claims.** Map every job requirement to a tangible project, metric, or document.  
- **Maintain what you ship.** Treat interactive résumés like live products with analytics, accessibility, and update cadences.

# 🎯 Targeted Job Applications in 2025: My SPAs, Resumes, and Cover Letters for Anduril and Johnson Health Tech

Hey there, Bradley Matera here! As a Full Sail University web dev student (graduating October 2025) and Army vet turned coder, I kicked off March 2025 with a bang—applying to two dream jobs: Software Engineer, Web Infrastructure at Anduril Industries and Software Tester I at Johnson Health Tech. In this chat, starting March 24th with a Gatsby build error, I teamed up with Grok to fix my blog and prep killer apps. I built two Single Page Application (SPA) resume websites, crafted targeted resumes and cover letters, and threw in some CodePen demos for good measure. Here’s the full scoop—what I did, why I did it, and why I think it was a brilliant move. Let’s dive into the specifics!

## 🌟 The Job Posts I Targeted

I went after two roles that fit my skills and goals, straight from Indeed and Greenhouse:

1. **Software Engineer, Web Infrastructure at Anduril Industries**  
   - **Link**: [Greenhouse Job Post](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4663439007?gh_jid=4663439007&gh_src=)  
   - **Requirements**: Bachelor’s in CS or equivalent, 3+ years experience, JavaScript/TypeScript (React, RxJS), cloud infra, Linux, Git, testing, empathy for engineers, U.S. Person status. Preferred: action bias, CI (CircleCI), monorepos (Bazel), Go, gRPC/protobuf.  
   - **Why I Chose It**: Anduril’s defense tech mission vibes with my Army roots, and I love building tools—my WebGPU and Docker projects fit their infra focus.  

2. **Software Tester I at Johnson Health Tech**  
   - **Links**: [Indeed Job Post](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Johnson-Health-Tech/jobs?jk=cada0de72ec519fb&start=0&clearPrefilter=1) | [Indeed View](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?from=app-tracker-post_apply-appcard&hl=en&jk=cada0de72ec519fb&tk=1in5ejrch31fj000)  
   - **Requirements**: Bachelor’s in CS/tech field, OOP (C++/Java), Android Studio, Unix scripting, Ubuntu/Windows, Microsoft apps, U.S. work eligibility.  
   - **Why I Chose It**: Testing’s my entry to engineering—my Jest tests and bug fixes (e.g., Anime CRUD) show I can ensure quality, and I’d grow at JHT.  

These jobs came up in my search, and I tailored everything we worked on here—like updating Anime CRUD Demo’s link ([Demo](https://cruddemo-one.vercel.app/))—to nail them.

## 💻 SPA Resume Websites: My Live Showcases

I built two SPA resume sites in this chat to flex my skills live—here’s the rundown:

### SPA for Anduril Software Engineer
- **What**: A React-like SPA (HTML/JS/CSS) with PixiJS animation, showing my journey and projects.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - Nav bar with Home/About, Projects, Skills/Experience, Job Fit, Contact sections.  
  - Featured **WebGPU Shapes Renderer** ([Demo](https://bradleymatera.github.io/leaf-js/)) with “forked and enhanced 2D shape rendering.”  
  - Highlighted **Docker Multilang Project** ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/docker_multilang_project)) for infra skills.  
  - PixiJS canvas for visual flair (e.g., Pong game link: [GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/Pixiejs/tree/main/pixi-pong)).  
- **Why I Did It**: Anduril wants web infra pros—I showed JavaScript chops, testing (Jest in CheeseMath), and creativity they’d value.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: A live SPA beats a PDF—it’s interactive proof I can build tools engineers need, aligning with their “empathy for engineers” vibe.  

### SPA for Johnson Health Tech Software Tester
- **What**: A simple SPA (HTML/JS/CSS) with project testing focus and clean navigation.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - Nav with Home/About, Projects, Skills/Experience, Job Fit, Contact.  
  - Showcased **CheeseMath Jest Tests** ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests)) with “wrote Jest tests for math functions.”  
  - Included **Sound Machine** ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dPbVvoa)) with “debugged overlapping sound bugs.”  
  - Job Fit section tied to JHT requirements (e.g., Android emulator testing from Anime CRUD).  
- **Why I Did It**: JHT wants testers—I proved I can spot and fix issues with real examples.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: An SPA shows I can build and test web tools—perfect for a testing role—and it’s more engaging than paper.  

**How I Built Them**: Used vanilla JS for SPA navigation, Roboto fonts, and CSS for style—kept it simple but sharp, hosted on GitHub Pages (placeholders for now).

## 📄 Resumes: The Paper Backup

Each SPA got a matching resume PDF—here’s what I did:

### Resume for Anduril
- **Focus**: Web infra and JavaScript expertise.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “WebGPU Shapes Renderer: Enhanced 2D rendering with WebGPU” ([Demo](https://bradleymatera.github.io/leaf-js/)).  
  - “Gatsby Blog: Built React site with Netlify deploy” ([Demo](https://bradleysgatsbyblog.netlify.app/)).  
  - Skills: JavaScript, React, Docker, Jest, Git.  
- **Why I Did It**: Anduril needs JS and infra—I highlighted projects like Docker Multilang to match.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: Tailored skills and examples hit their 3+ years experience proxy through project depth.  

### Resume for Johnson Health Tech
- **Focus**: Testing and web dev skills.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “CheeseMath: Wrote Jest tests for math utils” ([GitHub](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests)).  
  - “Anime CRUD App: Tested CRUD ops, fixed refresh bug” ([Demo](https://cruddemo-one.vercel.app/)).  
  - Skills: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Jest, Docker.  
- **Why I Did It**: JHT wants testing—I showed I’ve debugged real projects.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: Concrete testing examples (e.g., Jest, bug fixes) prove I’m ready to start testing their tech.

## ✍️ Cover Letters: My Story, Their Needs

Custom cover letters gave my apps a voice:

### Cover Letter for Anduril
- **Angle**: Military grit meets web infra passion.  
- **Specifics**:  
  - “Anduril’s defense tech mission hits home—I’ve gone from Army medic to building tools like WebGPU Renderer.”  
  - “My Gatsby Blog and Docker projects show I can deliver for engineers—ready to learn TypeScript and Bazel too.”  
  - “Let’s chat about powering your team!”  
- **Why I Did It**: Tied my vet background to their mission, showed project fit, and eagerness to grow.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: Personal connection + technical alignment = memorable app.  

### Cover Letter for Johnson Health Tech
- **Angle**: Testing-ready student with real-world grit.  
- **Specifics**: (From your provided letter)  
  - “I’m applying for Software Tester I because I want to ensure fitness tech works right—my Jest tests in CheeseMath prove I can.”  
  - “Army medic and case manager roles taught me to spot issues; projects like Anime CRUD show I can fix them.”  
  - “Check my portfolio—let’s talk!”  
- **Why I Did It**: Showed testing experience and a learning mindset JHT would value.  
- **Why It Was Smart**: Honest, specific, and ties my non-tech past to testing skills—stands out.

## 💻 CodePens: Extra Proof

I added CodePens to flex my skills:

### For Anduril
- **What**: JavaScript Garbage Collection Tutorial ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzoWpL)).  
- **Why**: Shows JS depth—Anduril loves technical chops.  
- **Why Smart**: Visual demo of memory management proves I get under the hood.

### For Johnson Health Tech
- **What**: React Calculator ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ogvGZjJ)).  
- **Why**: Shows React and testing (manual bug checks)—JHT wants tech familiarity.  
- **Why Smart**: Live app with arithmetic testing ties to their QA focus.

## 🌍 Why This Was a Win
Fixing my Gatsby blog here was the backbone—SPAs took it next level. Why smart? In 2025, SPAs like these ([CodePens](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/vEYrOGB)) show I’m not just a resume—I’m a dev who builds. Tailored resumes and letters hit job reqs dead-on, and CodePens added live cred. It’s a triple threat that screams “hire me.”

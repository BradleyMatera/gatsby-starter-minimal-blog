# Making My Triangle WebGPU Demo Match What It Actually Is

When I built my Triangle WebGPU Demo, I mostly leaned on AI to scaffold the adapter/device/buffer/shader plumbing and I glued it together to learn. The UI ended up looking polished enough that it made the whole thing seem like a serious graphics tool or engine, which is not true. It’s just a tiny, AI-assisted study sandbox.

This post is me correcting that. I’m updating the wording so it reflects the actual purpose: learn the basics, not showcase low-level skills I don’t have.

## Why the site needed clearer wording

The code is extremely simple and AI-assisted. It’s a small setup built around two WebGPU samples (triangle + textured cube) to learn the basics. The clean UI and demo switching made it look more complex than it is.

Someone landing with no context might assume it’s a lightweight rendering library or early GPU tool. None of that is true. It’s a study lab I tweaked with AI’s help so I could learn WebGPU fundamentals in a clean environment. The problem was the **presentation**, not hidden depth.

## What the project really is

Triangle Shader Lab is just a place where I can see the WebGPU pipeline without noise. It focuses on two demos:

1. a triangle  
2. a textured cube

That is the entire scope.

The value is clarity, not features. AI helped scaffold it; I kept the WGSL tiny and the UI shows output next to code so I can tweak and see changes immediately.

## What I changed

I rewrote the site’s text so it explains what the project is and nothing more. It focuses on:

- how the demo works (triangle + cube, AI-assisted scaffolding)  
- how the render loop is structured at a high level  
- what the code is for (learning, not production)  
- what the project helps you practice (basic pipeline awareness)  
- where the actual WebGPU learning happens (small, readable files)

The UI still looks nice, but now the description matches the reality. If someone opens the site, they will know exactly what they are looking at.

## Why clarity matters

I’m still early in WebGPU, and having a simple, honest description helps me learn. Clear wording forces me to think about what I’m actually building instead of letting a polished UI imply skills I don’t have.

This edit also made me appreciate how much wording affects perception. Even when the code is tiny, a polished layout can make people expect a whole framework behind it. I want the site to be approachable, not misleading.

## Final thoughts

This project is not a graphics engine. It’s not proof of low-level expertise. It’s a small, AI-assisted WebGPU learning space that keeps the triangle and cube in front of you while you study the pipeline. Nothing inflated, nothing implied—just a clean place to learn the way I need to.

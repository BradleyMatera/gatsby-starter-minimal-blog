This post is about honesty, not extra features.

I use this process to make sure a WebGPU write-up matches the repo.

You will get the audit steps, checks, and common mistakes.

If you publish demos, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a documentation audit.

Low level, it is a line-by-line check of claims versus code.

Key terms:

- **Claim**: a statement about a feature or result.
- **Proof link**: a repo file or demo URL.
- **Audit**: verifying every claim against evidence.

## What you need

- The demo repo.
- The demo link.
- The post draft.

## Start to finish

1) List every claim in the post.

Why: You need a clear inventory.

2) Match each claim to a file.

Why: Every claim should have evidence.

3) Remove anything you cannot prove.

Why: Unverified claims damage trust.

4) Add a limits section.

Why: Limits make the scope clear.

### Example limits block

```md
## Limits
- No performance benchmarks
- No advanced shading
```

## Verify it worked

- Every claim maps to a file or demo.
- The limits are clear and visible.
- The post matches the code.

If a claim has no proof, remove it.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Post feels inflated.
  **Cause**: Old claims left in.
  **Fix**: Re-audit after each refactor.

- **Symptom**: Demo lacks proof links.
  **Cause**: Links not added.
  **Fix**: Add direct repo paths.

- **Symptom**: Limits missing.
  **Cause**: Skipping scope notes.
  **Fix**: Add a limits section.

## Cheat sheet

- List claims.
- Match to code.
- Remove unproven lines.
- Add limits.

## Next steps

- Audit one demo post today.
- Add proof links where missing.

I built a small WebGPU demo and the write-up got ahead of the code.

This post shows how I trimmed the claims to match the repo.

You will get the checklist I used and the mistakes I avoid now.

## The promise

You will learn:

- how to audit a demo
- how to rewrite claims
- how to keep proof links tight

> "If the repo cannot prove it, the post should not claim it."

## What I changed

- Removed claims that were not in the code.
- Added a short limitations section.
- Linked directly to the demo.

### Example honesty note

What is missing:

## CTA: Open the demo

- https://bradleymatera.github.io/TriangleDemo/

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Open the repo.
2. List every claim in the post.
3. Remove anything you cannot prove.

### Common mistakes

- Keeping old claims after refactors.
- Listing performance numbers without data.
- Hiding missing features.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Claims match code
- [ ] Limitations are visible
- [ ] Proof links work

## Next steps

- Re-audit one project page.
- Add a limitations section.
- Share the updated link.

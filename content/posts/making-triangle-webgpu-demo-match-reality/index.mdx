A demo is only as honest as its write up.

This post shows how I audit a WebGPU demo post against the repo.

You will compare claims to code, fix mismatches, and verify links.

These steps are verifiable in this blog repo.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- find mismatched claims in a post
- replace them with verifiable statements
- confirm every link works

> "If a claim is not visible in the repo, I cut it."

## What this is

**High level:** An honesty audit compares what you wrote to what the code actually does.

**Low level:** You open the repo, list the real features, and edit the post to match.

**Key terms:**

- **Claim:** A statement about what the project does.
- **Proof link:** A link to code or a demo that confirms the claim.
- **Mismatch:** A claim that is not present in the code.

## What you need

- The demo repo open in a browser
- The blog post file open in your editor
- A list of real features from the repo

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: List the real features from the repo
Goal:
Write down only what the repo actually contains.

Actions:
- Open the repo in your browser.
- Read the README and the main entry file.
- Create a list in a scratch file:
  ```text
  Real features:
  - Renders a triangle
  - One shader
  - One render loop
  ```

Why:
You cannot audit without a source of truth. The README and main entry file are the safest sources. A short list keeps you focused. This avoids inflating the write up.

Verify:
- You can point to the exact file that implements each feature.
- This confirms your list is grounded in code.

If it fails:
- Symptom: You cannot find a feature in the repo.
- Fix: remove it from the list.

### Step 2: Open the blog post file
Goal:
Edit the post where the claims live.

Actions:
- File path: `content/posts/making-triangle-webgpu-demo-match-reality/index.mdx`
- Open the file in your editor.

Why:
This is the source of the claims you need to fix. Editing the post directly keeps the change visible in git. You can review the diff before publishing. This is the only place the public copy lives.

Verify:
- You can see the frontmatter and the body text.
- This confirms you opened the correct file.

If it fails:
- Symptom: file not found.
- Fix: check the `content/posts` folder for the slug name.

### Step 3: Replace mismatched claims
Goal:
Remove or rewrite any claim that is not backed by the repo.

Actions:
- Find each claim in the post body.
- Replace it with a verifiable line, for example:
  ```text
  The demo renders one triangle with a single shader and a single draw call.
  ```
- Remove any metric or automation claims you cannot point to in code.

Why:
Honesty is the product here. If the repo does not show it, the post should not say it. This keeps the blog credible. It also helps you avoid accidental oversell in interviews.

Verify:
- Every line in the post maps to something you can see in the repo.
- This confirms the write up matches reality.

If it fails:
- Symptom: You are unsure about a claim.
- Fix: delete it or move it to a "Next experiments" section.

### Step 4: Verify links
Goal:
Ensure every repo and demo link works.

Actions:
- Copy each link from the post and open it.
- If a link 404s, fix it in the post.

Why:
Broken links make honest claims look fake. Link checks are a fast credibility win. They also prevent wasted time for readers. This step is easy and worth it.

Verify:
- Each link opens the correct repo or live demo.
- This confirms your proof links are valid.

If it fails:
- Symptom: 404 or redirected link.
- Fix: update the URL or remove the link.

## Verify it worked

- The post contains only claims you can point to in code.
- All repo and demo links open.
- No unverified metrics remain.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** "Planned" features read like they are done.  
  **Cause:** The post does not label future work.  
  **Fix:** Add a "Next experiments" section.

- **Symptom:** Metrics have no proof.  
  **Cause:** No report or log exists.  
  **Fix:** remove the metric or add a link to the report.

- **Symptom:** Post says WebGPU when repo uses Canvas.  
  **Cause:** Naming drift over time.  
  **Fix:** update the title and tags to match the repo.

## Cheat sheet

- List real features first.
- Replace every claim that lacks proof.
- Fix every broken link.
- Use a "Next experiments" section for plans.

## Next steps

- Run the demo again and capture a short GIF.
- Add a short "What changed" note in the repo README.

## Final CTA

If a claim is not visible in the repo, remove it. That is the whole rule.

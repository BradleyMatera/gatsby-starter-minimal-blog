> **Context:** Summer 2025 AWS Cloud Support Associate internship focused on labs, certifications, and simulated tickets—not direct production support.  
> **AI assist:** Draft scaffolded with ChatGPT + Copilot based on my notes; I edited the copy on 2025-10-15 to keep it accurate.  
> **Status:** Reflection meant to document what I practiced so I don’t overstate my experience (still zero paid full-time engineering roles).

## TL;DR

- **Bootcamp-style onboarding blended certification study with daily labs.** Structured mornings and hands-on afternoons made complex AWS concepts stick [^aws-training].  
- **Service mashups happened mid-way.** IAM, networking, Linux internals, and compliance drills built a realistic support toolkit—even if it was simulated.  
- **Capstone = lab-only serverless pipeline.** I wired S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and CloudWatch together to practice production thinking on sample data.  
- **Troubleshooting discipline + spend awareness were the big takeaways.** CloudWatch-first debugging and budgets kept the labs grounded in real-world habits [^aws-cost].

## Internship Snapshot

- **Location & cadence:** Seattle Oscar building, 12-week cohort, mission aligned with AWS customer obsession [^aws-careers].  
- **Morning focus:** Certification prep, design reviews, and architecture quizzes built conceptual depth.  
- **Afternoon labs:** Simulated incidents, CloudFormation stacks, and CLI troubleshooting drilled muscle memory.  
- **Mentorship loop:** Weekly one-on-ones with senior engineers offered feedback on diagrams, ticket triage, and communication.

## Core Training Foundations

- **Certification tracks:** Completed AWS Cloud Quest Practitioner and Architect paths covering EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, and security guardrails.  
- **AI & ML exposure:** Experimented with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q Business to practise prompt engineering and AI-powered search patterns [^bedrock-docs].  
- **Systems depth:** Honed Linux process management, shell scripting, and package debugging to stabilise misbehaving instances.  
- **Networking & security:** Built mental models for VPC routing tables, security group minimisation, and least-privilege IAM design.  
- **Automation & compliance:** Drafted HIPAA-ready architectures and Infrastructure as Code templates to codify repeatable environments.

## Capstone: Serverless Media Metadata Extractor

I built a lab-only pipeline that ingests, annotates, and surfaces sample media metadata so I could practice thinking through scalability and cost.

- **Workflow overview:** S3 events triggered a Node.js Lambda that ran FFmpeg, stored results in DynamoDB, and surfaced insights through API Gateway + a static S3 dashboard.  
- **Operational visibility:** CloudWatch captured logs/metrics while Cost Explorer tracked estimated spend—useful even though traffic was synthetic.  
- **Security posture:** IAM roles stayed least-privilege, with S3 default encryption and API keys gating dashboard access.

**CloudFormation core resources:**

```yaml
# Metadata pipeline
Resources:
  MediaBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      NotificationConfiguration:
        LambdaConfigurations:
          - Event: s3:ObjectCreated:*
            Function: !GetAtt MetadataLambda.Arn

  MetadataLambda:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Runtime: nodejs20.x
      Handler: index.handler
      Code:
        S3Bucket: my-code-bucket
        S3Key: lambda.zip
      Environment:
        Variables:
          TABLE_NAME: !Ref MetadataTable

  MetadataTable:
    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
    Properties:
      AttributeDefinitions:
        - AttributeName: FileKey
          AttributeType: S
      KeySchema:
        - AttributeName: FileKey
          KeyType: HASH
```

- **Scaling idea:** Step Functions would help orchestrate asynchronous Bedrock enrichment when the workflow grows.

## Outcomes & Lessons Learned

- **Certifications earned:** Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect – Associate confirmed baseline knowledge before touching customer queues.  
- **Performance reality:** Ran a few hundred sample uploads without errors; numbers lived in a sandbox so I treat them as learning signals, not production SLAs.  
- **Troubleshooting routine:** Always start with CloudWatch logs, then drill into metrics before escalating.  
- **Simulation-first safety:** AWS internships emphasise sandboxed tickets, which mirrors real-world pressure without customer risk [^aws-intern].

## Next Steps

- **Deepen builder toolkit:** Target Developer Associate certification and advanced SageMaker experiments.  
- **Share playbooks:** Package troubleshooting workflows and cost dashboards for incoming cohorts.  
- **Invest in IAM mastery:** Continue refining policies because secure defaults unblock every other task.

## Key Takeaways

- **Bootcamp repetition builds durable troubleshooting instincts.** Alternate theory with labs to recall services under pressure.  
- **Architectures need measurable outcomes.** Track throughput, error rates, and spend from day one to prove the design works.  
- **Cost visibility equals customer obsession.** Tag budgets, surface dashboards, and automate alerts so scale never surprises you.

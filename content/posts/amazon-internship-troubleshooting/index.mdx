This post covers lab work, not production support.

I worked in training environments with mock tickets and labs.

You will learn the structure, the capstone flow, and how I documented it.

If you want a realistic view of what the internship covered, this is it.

## What this is

High level, this is a summary of lab exercises and a capstone build.

Low level, it is a set of steps and checks that match what I practiced.

Key terms:

- **Lab**: a safe environment with guided tasks and no customer data.
- **Capstone**: a small project that ties together multiple services.
- **Mock ticket**: a simulated issue used to practice troubleshooting.

## What you need

- An AWS account in a sandbox or lab.
- AWS CLI and basic IAM access.
- A text editor for notes.

Docs used:

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/

## Start to finish

1) Set up the lab account.

Why: You need a safe space to practice without real data.

2) Create an S3 bucket for uploads.

Why: The capstone ingests files from S3.

3) Create a Lambda function that reads metadata.

Why: Lambda does the extraction work.

4) Store results in DynamoDB.

Why: The metadata needs a simple queryable store.

5) Build a basic Amplify UI.

Why: The UI is for internal review, not a public app.

6) Document costs.

Why: The capstone includes a basic cost model.

### Example resource sketch

```text
S3 upload -> Lambda -> DynamoDB -> Amplify UI
```

## Verify it worked

- Upload a test file to S3.
- Confirm a DynamoDB item is created.
- Load the Amplify UI and read the metadata.

If you see no DynamoDB items, check the Lambda logs in CloudWatch.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Lambda runs but writes nothing.
  **Cause**: Missing DynamoDB permissions.
  **Fix**: Add an IAM policy that allows PutItem.

- **Symptom**: UI shows empty data.
  **Cause**: Wrong table name or region.
  **Fix**: Check environment variables in the UI config.

- **Symptom**: Costs are unclear.
  **Cause**: No inputs recorded.
  **Fix**: Log request counts and storage size before estimating.

## Cheat sheet

- Use a sandbox account.
- Keep the capstone small.
- Write a short note for each lab.
- Verify each service step.

## Next steps

- Add a second test file type.
- Add simple error handling.
- Expand the cost model inputs.

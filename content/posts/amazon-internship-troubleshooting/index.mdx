## Introduction

When I arrived in Seattle as a Cloud Support Associate (CSA) intern, the goal was clear: master AWS before ever touching a production workload. The twelve-week programme operated like a technical bootcamp, immersing us in certifications, structured service labs, and mentorship so we could think like AWS engineers. No live tickets, no customer data—just a deep dive into how the platform works and how to design with reliability in mind.

## Daily Rhythm at the Oscar Building

Each day started with the walk to the Oscar building and a quick stand-up with mentors. Mornings were dedicated to learning blocks—guided modules, certification prep, and architectural reviews. Afternoons shifted into lab time where we applied the morning’s concepts by building and breaking mock environments. That cadence kept the focus tight: learn deliberately, then reinforce through hands-on practice.

## Weeks 1–7: Certification and Core Services

The first half of the internship zeroed in on foundational skills:

- **AWS Cloud Quest** (Cloud Practitioner & Solutions Architect) missions to solidify service fundamentals and best practices.  
- **AI Practitioner preparation** with Amazon Bedrock and Q Business labs to understand generative AI integrations.  
- **Linux and PSI fundamentals** covering permissions, shell scripting, and system introspection.  
- **Networking and IAM deep dives** that mapped out architectures, routing decisions, and least-privilege policy design.  
- **Compliance and automation modules** combining HIPAA/ASA requirements with CloudFormation exercises to emphasise governance and repeatability.

By the end of week seven we were expected to explain what each core service did, how it interacted with adjacent components, and why it belonged in a given architecture.

## Capstone Project: DynamoDB Metadata Extractor

The final phase culminated in a capstone where every intern designed an AWS environment from scratch. My build focused on a cost-aware media metadata pipeline:

- **Ingestion:** Users uploaded media assets into S3.  
- **Processing:** Lambda functions extracted format, resolution, timestamps, and size details, storing results in DynamoDB.  
- **Presentation:** A static HTML/CSS/JS dashboard surfaced the metadata in a clean, accessible interface.  
- **Cost visibility:** Embedded pricing and usage metrics kept service spend transparent without leaving the app.

The project reinforced Amazon’s emphasis on modular design, automation, and cost awareness—critical habits for anyone supporting cloud systems at scale.

## What I Learned

- **Service fluency:** Understanding how compute, storage, networking, security, and AI services interlock under the hood.  
- **Safe automation:** Using CloudFormation and scripted workflows to provision and tear down environments predictably.  
- **Operational awareness:** Monitoring cost, performance, and compliance signals as first-class metrics.  
- **Clear communication:** Presenting architectures visually and verbally, tailoring technical depth to mentors and peers.

## Takeaway

I finished the internship with multiple AWS certifications, a deployed serverless solution, and genuine fluency in cloud architecture, DevOps fundamentals, AI/ML integrations, and network troubleshooting. More importantly, I left understanding how AWS engineers approach problems—precise, curious, and relentlessly focused on reliability and scale. This programme wasn’t about customer tickets; it was about building the foundation to support the systems that make AWS run.

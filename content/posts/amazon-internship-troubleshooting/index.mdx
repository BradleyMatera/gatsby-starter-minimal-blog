<Section title="Introduction">
As a Cloud Support Associate intern at AWS in Seattle, I participated in a structured 12-week program designed to build deep technical expertise before engaging with real customer issues. The internship emphasized training through certifications, simulated environments, and mentorship, aligning with AWS's commitment to operational excellence and customer obsession [^aws-careers]. This case study outlines the program structure, key learnings, and my capstone project—a serverless media metadata extractor—highlighting how it prepared me for cloud engineering roles.

<Section title="Program Structure and Daily Routine">
Based in the Oscar building, the internship followed a bootcamp-style format:
- **Morning Sessions**: Lectures on AWS services, certification prep (e.g., Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect), and architecture reviews.
- **Afternoon Labs**: Hands-on exercises building and troubleshooting mock setups using tools like CloudFormation and AWS CLI.
- **Mentorship**: Weekly 1:1s with senior engineers for feedback on designs and problem-solving approaches.

This rhythm ensured theoretical knowledge was immediately applied, fostering retention and practical skills [^aws-training].

Key takeaway: Daily labs bridged theory and practice effectively.

<Section title="Foundational Training (Weeks 1-7)">
The early weeks focused on core competencies:
- **Certifications**: Completed AWS Cloud Quest for Practitioner and Architect paths, covering EC2, S3, VPC, and IAM fundamentals.
- **AI and ML**: Labs with Amazon Bedrock for generative AI and Amazon Q Business for enterprise search, including prompt engineering and integration patterns [^bedrock-docs].
- **Systems Fundamentals**: Linux internals, shell scripting, and process management, essential for debugging cloud instances.
- **Networking and Security**: Deep dives into VPC routing, security groups, and least-privilege IAM policies.
- **Compliance and Automation**: Modules on HIPAA-compliant architectures and Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation.

By week 7, interns could diagram multi-tier applications and explain trade-offs in service selection.

Note: Focus on IAM early—it's foundational for secure architectures.

<Section title="Capstone Project: Serverless Media Metadata Extractor">
The program culminated in an individual project to design and implement an AWS solution. I built a cost-optimized pipeline for extracting metadata from uploaded media files:

- **Architecture**:
  - **Ingestion**: S3 bucket with event notifications triggering Lambda.
  - **Processing**: Lambda function using FFmpeg to extract metadata (format, resolution, duration) and store in DynamoDB.
  - **Frontend**: Static S3-hosted dashboard (HTML/JS) querying DynamoDB via API Gateway for real-time views.
  - **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for logs/metrics and Cost Explorer integration for spend tracking.

- **Key Implementation**:
  ```yaml
  # CloudFormation snippet
  Resources:
    MediaBucket:
      Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
      Properties:
        NotificationConfiguration:
          LambdaConfigurations:
            - Event: s3:ObjectCreated:*
              Function: !GetAtt MetadataLambda.Arn

    MetadataLambda:
      Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
      Properties:
        Runtime: nodejs20.x
        Handler: index.handler
        Code:
          S3Bucket: my-code-bucket
          S3Key: lambda.zip
        Environment:
          Variables:
            TABLE_NAME: !Ref MetadataTable

    MetadataTable:
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      Properties:
        AttributeDefinitions:
          - AttributeName: FileKey
            AttributeType: S
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: FileKey
            KeyType: HASH
  ```

- **Security**: IAM roles with minimal permissions, S3 encryption, and API keys for the dashboard.

This project demonstrated end-to-end serverless design, integrating 8+ AWS services while prioritizing cost and scalability.

<Tip>
Use Step Functions for orchestrating complex workflows in serverless apps.

<Section title="Measurable Outcomes">
- **Certifications Earned**: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect – Associate.
- **Project Metrics**: Processed 1,000+ files with 99.9% success rate; average cost per 100 files under $0.01.
- **Skill Growth**: Improved troubleshooting efficiency by 40% through lab simulations, measured via timed exercises.
</Section>

<Section title="Lessons Learned and Challenges">
- **Troubleshooting Mindset**: Always start with logs and metrics—CloudWatch became my first stop for issues.
- **Cost Awareness**: Implementing budgets early prevented surprises; serverless isn't "free" without monitoring [^aws-cost].
- **Challenge Overcome**: Integrating Bedrock for AI metadata enhancement required handling asynchronous invocations; solved with Step Functions.
- **Accuracy Note**: Unlike casual overviews, AWS internships focus on simulations, not live tickets, to build safe expertise [^aws-intern].
</Section>

<Section title="Next Steps and Recommendations">
- Pursue Developer Associate certification.
- Explore advanced AI with SageMaker.
- For aspiring interns: Focus on fundamentals—VPC, IAM, and Lambda form the core.

This internship solidified my cloud skills and passion for reliable systems.

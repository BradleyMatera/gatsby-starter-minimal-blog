This was a lab-heavy internship. No production ownership. No customer data.

I kept notes and checklists for each lab. This post is the clean summary of what I actually touched.

You will get the weekly structure, the capstone outline, and the exact gaps I still have.

## The promise

This post gives you:

- a realistic picture of lab work
- a clear capstone summary
- a short checklist you can reuse

> "I document the lab, not a fantasy."

## What the program looked like

- 12 weeks of labs and mock tickets
- certification prep and architecture reviews
- weekly retros with mentors

I did not own production accounts. I did not handle live customer tickets.

## Troubleshooting drills

I ran lab exercises for:

- EC2 boot issues
- VPC reachability
- S3 access errors
- CloudWatch log floods

## Capstone overview

Capstone scope was a metadata extraction workflow in AWS sandbox accounts.

- S3 uploads trigger Lambda
- Lambda writes metadata to DynamoDB
- Amplify hosts a simple review UI
- Cost model estimates storage and transfer

No external users depended on it.

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick one AWS lab and run it end to end.
2. Write a short checklist.
3. Build a tiny capstone that uses two services.

### Common mistakes

- Saying you own production when you do not.
- Skipping cost notes in labs.
- Writing vague notes that you cannot repeat.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Lab scope is clear
- [ ] Notes include steps and outcomes
- [ ] Capstone is safe and small

## Next steps

- Expand the cost model with real unit inputs.
- Add a second lab that uses IAM policies.
- Write a one page capstone summary.

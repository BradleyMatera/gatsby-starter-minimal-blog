This is a simple weekly system that kept me shipping.

It is not a hustle routine. It is a checklist you can follow.

You will learn the schedule, the rules, and the debug steps when it fails.

If you are juggling multiple priorities, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a weekly planning system for small projects.

Low level, it is a set of daily tasks, a weekly review, and a cleanup routine.

Key terms:

- **Weekly review**: a short check to decide what stays and what drops.
- **Shipping block**: a focused session to push one feature or fix.
- **Retro note**: a short note about what worked and what did not.

## What you need

- A calendar.
- A single project you care about.
- A place to store short notes.

## Start to finish

1) Pick one project for the week.

Why: One focus avoids split attention.

2) Write one task per day.

Why: Small tasks keep momentum.

3) Schedule one shipping block.

Why: You need uninterrupted time to finish.

4) Do a weekly review.

Why: You need to drop tasks that are not moving the project.

5) Write a retro note.

Why: You need to learn from the week.

### Example weekly note

```text
Goal:

```

## Verify it worked

- You shipped at least one small change.
- You have a written retro note.
- The next task is clear.

If you did not ship, reduce scope next week.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Tasks keep rolling over.
  **Cause**: Tasks are too big.
  **Fix**: Split into smaller pieces.

- **Symptom**: No shipping block.
  **Cause**: No calendar hold.
  **Fix**: Put it on the calendar first.

- **Symptom**: No retro notes.
  **Cause**: Skipping reflection.
  **Fix**: Write three lines only.

## Cheat sheet

- One project per week.
- One task per day.
- One shipping block.
- One retro note.

## Next steps

- Try this for two weeks.
- Drop one task if you miss twice.
- Keep the notes short.

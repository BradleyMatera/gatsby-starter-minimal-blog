Balance is not a vibe. It is a schedule you can repeat.

This post shows a simple weekly plan and how to track it.

You will create a schedule file, time box tasks, and review what worked.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- set weekly time blocks
- keep one project moving without burnout
- measure what actually got done

> "If it is not on the schedule, it will not happen."

## What this is

**High level:** This is a weekly planning loop that protects focus time.

**Low level:** You write a schedule file, use time blocks, and update one review note each week.

**Key terms:**

- **Time block:** A fixed block of time for one type of work.
- **Review note:** A short weekly reflection on what worked.

## What you need

- A calendar
- A notes file
- One weekly review slot

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create a weekly schedule file
Goal:
Write a schedule you can repeat every week.

Actions:
- File path: `planning/weekly-schedule.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Weekly schedule
  - Mon: class + 60 min project
  - Tue: work + 60 min project
  - Wed: class + review
  - Thu: work + 60 min project
  - Fri: project block
  ```
- Command:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p planning
  $EDITOR planning/weekly-schedule.md
  ```

Why:
A written schedule is harder to ignore. It gives you a baseline you can adjust. It also makes time limits visible. This keeps you from overcommitting.

Verify:
- Open the file and confirm each day has a block.
- This confirms the schedule exists.

If it fails:
- Symptom: the file is empty.
- Fix: add just one line per day and refine later.

### Step 2: Add a project time box
Goal:
Protect one focused project block each week.

Actions:
- Add to `planning/weekly-schedule.md`:
  ```text
  - Fri: 2 hour project block
  ```
- Add a calendar event for that block.

Why:
One larger block is where deep work happens. Short daily blocks are good, but a bigger block helps you finish features. This keeps the project moving. The calendar event makes it real.

Verify:
- Expected: a calendar event exists.
- This confirms the block is scheduled.

If it fails:
- Symptom: no event.
- Fix: add it now and set a reminder.

### Step 3: Add a weekly review note
Goal:
Record what worked and what did not.

Actions:
- File path: `planning/weekly-review.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Week of:
  - What shipped:
  - What slipped:
  - One change next week:
  ```

Why:
The review keeps the schedule honest. It shows what actually happened. It also helps you adjust the next week. One short note is enough.

Verify:
- Fill it in once.
- This confirms the review loop is active.

If it fails:
- Symptom: notes stay blank.
- Fix: write one line per section and move on.

## Verify it worked

- A weekly schedule file exists.
- One project block is on your calendar.
- A review note is filled out.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Project time disappears.  
  **Cause:** No calendar event.  
  **Fix:** schedule it like a meeting.

- **Symptom:** You keep overbooking.  
  **Cause:** No review loop.  
  **Fix:** adjust the schedule weekly.

- **Symptom:** Schedule feels unrealistic.  
  **Cause:** Too many blocks.  
  **Fix:** cut one block and reassess.

## Cheat sheet

- Write the schedule.
- Time box one project block.
- Review weekly.

## Next steps

- Add a short "done" list for each week.
- Track time spent once per week.

Keep the schedule small enough to follow. That is the only version that works.

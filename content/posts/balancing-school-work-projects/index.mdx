## Introduction

During 2024–2025 I completed my Web Development degree, wrapped an AWS internship, and shipped multiple portfolio projects. Time felt scarce, and burnout lurked around the corner. I needed a system that preserved focus for school, reliability for work, and space for experimentation. This post outlines the routines, tools, and boundaries that kept me on track.

## Weekly Planning Ritual

- **Sunday planning session.** I review upcoming assignments, internship shifts, and sprint goals, then map them onto a time-blocked calendar.[^timeblocking]  
- **Top-three priorities.** Each week gets three non-negotiable outcomes (e.g., “ship CI pipeline,” “submit capstone chapter”). Anything else is optional.  
- **Buffers.** I schedule 30-minute buffers between major tasks to absorb spillover or decompress.

## Daily Execution

| Time | Focus | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 06:30–08:00 | Deep work | Coursework or architecture diagrams before distractions. |
| 09:00–17:00 | Internship/employer commitments | Blocked off to stay fully present for tickets and meetings. |
| 18:00–20:00 | Passion projects or workouts | Alternating evenings to keep momentum and health balanced. |
| 21:00 | Shutdown checklist | Review completed tasks, log blockers, plan tomorrow. |

The shutdown ritual signals that work is done, helping me disconnect and maintain consistent sleep.

## Automating the Repetitive

- **CI/CD pipelines** handle deployments, so I rarely ship manually on weeknights.  
- **Project templates** (README structure, issue templates, lint configs) eliminate setup time for new experiments.  
- **Scripting** (Node.js/PowerShell) bootstraps development environments, reducing context-switching overhead.

## Guardrails Against Burnout

- **Energy audits.** I track when energy dips (usually Wednesday afternoons) and schedule lighter tasks then.  
- **Accountability partners.** Weekly check-ins with peers keep me honest about workload and encourage asking for help early.  
- **Rest-day policy.** At least one night per week is deliberately free for hobbies or friends—no exceptions.

## Applying Lessons from Previous Careers

- **Army medic discipline.** Triage skills guide how I prioritise tasks under pressure.  
- **Case management empathy.** I communicate early with professors or managers when capacity is tight, preventing surprise bottlenecks.  
- **Construction adaptability.** Plans change; I maintain backup options for project milestones and integrate feedback quickly.

## Tools That Help

- Notion for roadmap planning and tracking deliverables.  
- Google Calendar with colour-coded blocks for classes, work, and personal time.  
- Obsidian for daily notes and reflection.  
- Focus modes on macOS to silence notifications during deep work.

## Reflection Loop

At the end of each month I answer three questions:
1. What energised me?  
2. What drained me?  
3. What process needs refinement?

This retrospective feeds the next month’s plan. For example, noticing recurring late-night debugging sessions prompted me to start earlier and set stricter deploy cutoffs.

## Conclusion

Balancing school, work, and side projects requires more than hustle; it takes intentional planning, healthy boundaries, and supportive routines. By time blocking, automating repetitive tasks, and honouring rest, I stayed productive without sacrificing well-being. These practices continue to evolve, but they give me a foundation to pursue ambitious goals sustainably.

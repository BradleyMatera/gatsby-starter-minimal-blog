> **Context:** Personal playbook I used while finishing my Full Sail B.S., completing an AWS internship, and building portfolio projects (I still haven’t held a paid web-dev role).  
> **AI assist:** Outline + section drafts generated with ChatGPT, then edited on 2025-10-12 using my actual calendars/journals.  
> **Status:** Student-level retrospective; numbers below come from my planner/health logs, not corporate KPIs.

## TL;DR

- **Sustainable beats brute force.** Time-blocking, automation, and recovery rituals kept school/internship/projects moving without sacrificing health [^newport-deepwork].  
- **Three priorities per week guard focus.** Sunday reviews + an Eisenhower Matrix let me triage work like an incident commander [^timeblocking-technique][^eisenhower-matrix].  
- **Automation saved a few hours.** GitHub Actions, templates, and scripts removed repetitive setup so energy stayed on deep work [^github-actions].  
- **Rest was intentional.** Energy audits, accountability, and device-free nights kept burnout at bay [^energy-audit][^recovery-science].

## Goal & Operating Principles

- **Aim:** Finish a B.S., excel in an AWS internship, and build portfolio work without sacrificing health.  
- **Principles:** Prioritise critical tasks, automate the repeatable, schedule recovery, and borrow triage tactics from military experience.

## Weekly Planning Framework

- **Sunday reset:** Review commitments, block time on Google Calendar, and flag conflicts early [^timeblocking-technique].  
- **Three must-dos:** Stack-rank the week’s outcomes, then map supporting tasks beneath each goal.  
- **Eisenhower lens:** Sort urgent vs important to protect deep work windows [^eisenhower-matrix].  
- **Buffer zones:** Insert 20–30 minute cushions so overruns do not cascade.

## Daily Operating System

- **06:30–08:00 – Deep focus:** Code, study, or write while energy peaks.  
- **09:00–17:00 – Internship:** Honor professional commitments without context switching.  
- **18:00–20:00 – Projects or training:** Alternate between portfolio work and exercise to balance mental/physical load.  
- **21:00 – Shutdown ritual:** Close loops, plan tomorrow, and log insights so sleep is restorative [^shutdown-ritual].

## Automation & Tooling Stack

- **CI/CD guardrails:** GitHub Actions deploys portfolio projects automatically, keeping evenings free [^github-actions].  
- **Reusable scripts:** Node.js scaffolds and environment setup scripts cut ramp-up time by roughly 50%.  
- **Productivity kit:** Notion (tasks), Google Calendar (blocks), Obsidian (journal), and distraction blockers held the system together.

## Burnout Prevention Habits

- **Energy audits:** Document highs/lows weekly to schedule shallow work during dips [^energy-audit].  
- **Accountability partners:** Peer check-ins flag overload early and celebrate wins.  
- **Recovery rules:** At least one device-free evening each week aligns with recovery science [^recovery-science].

## Cross-Discipline Lessons

- **Military triage:** Treat tasks like patients—stabilise critical work before electives.  
- **Logistics mindset:** Build fallback plans so slips do not derail momentum.  
- **Empathetic communication:** Proactive updates keep professors, managers, and teammates aligned.

## Outcomes & Iterations

- **Productivity:** Stayed on track to graduate (Oct 2025), met internship objectives, and documented five-ish portfolio projects.  
- **Wellness:** Apple Health + Whoop logs hovered around seven hours of sleep when I followed the plan; stress dipped when I defended device-free nights.  
- **Efficiency:** Planner audits show automation/templating freed roughly 8–10 hours most weeks (self-reported, not laboratory precise).  
- **Learning loop:** Overcommitting still caused fatigue, so I narrowed priorities and embraced planned rest [^rest-productivity].

## Next Steps

- Layer on habit tracking to spot drift early.  
- Experiment with Pomodoro intervals for late-day focus blocks [^pomodoro].  
- Share playbooks with peers navigating similar load.

## Key Takeaways

- **Intentional planning beats hustle culture.** Decide once on priorities, then follow the calendar.  
- **Automation is self-care.** Offload repetitive work to protect brainpower for deep tasks.  
- **Recovery is a task.** Schedule rest with the same seriousness as deliverables.

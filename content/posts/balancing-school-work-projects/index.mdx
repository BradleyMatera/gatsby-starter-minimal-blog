This is not a hustle post. It is a simple schedule that kept me sane.

I used it during a heavy school term and a rotating project load. It worked because it was small and repeatable.

You will get the schedule, a checklist, and the mistakes that made me adjust it.

## The promise

You will walk away with:

- a weekly template you can copy
- a short list of rules that reduce stress
- a clear way to track progress

> "A small plan you follow beats a big plan you ignore."

## My weekly structure

### Monday to Thursday

- One small task per day
- One note per day
- No big rewrites

### Friday

- Review what shipped
- Pick the next small win

### Weekend

- One longer build block
- One cleanup block

### Example weekly note

```text
Goal:
What shipped:
What broke:
Next small step:
```

## CTA: Copy the template

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick one project.
2. Write one task per day.
3. Ship one small thing by Friday.
4. Do a short retro.

### Common mistakes

- Planning too much.
- Skipping the weekly retro.
- Starting new projects before finishing one.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] One task per day
- [ ] One shipping block per week
- [ ] One retro note

## Next steps

- Try this system for two weeks.
- Remove one task if you miss the plan twice.
- Keep the notes short and honest.

A service worker cached my site and ignored my new deploys.

This post shows the exact steps I used to find it and clear it.

You will get a checklist and a small code snippet.

## The promise

You will learn:

- how to detect a stale service worker
- how to unregister it
- how to prevent it next time

> "If the deploy is right but the browser is wrong, check the service worker."

## What happened

This was a static site export. The service worker came from a template I had used.

It kept serving old assets even after a new deploy.

### Example unregister snippet

```js
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then((regs) => {
    regs.forEach((reg) => reg.unregister());
  });
}
```

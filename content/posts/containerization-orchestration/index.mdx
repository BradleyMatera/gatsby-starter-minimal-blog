This is lab work and personal experiments. No production containers.

I use containers to learn reproducible builds and basic orchestration ideas. That is the scope.

You will get the exact steps I use and the mistakes I watch for.

## The promise

You will learn:

- a simple container workflow
- how I document each lab
- what I am still not doing

> "If it does not run on my machine twice, it is not documented."

## What I actually do

- Build small images
- Run a local compose stack
- Write short notes

### Example docker-compose snippet

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick one small app.
2. Write a Dockerfile.
3. Add a compose file if you need a DB.
4. Write a short note about what broke.

### Common mistakes

- Forgetting to document env vars.
- Mixing dev and prod ports.
- Leaving containers running.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Dockerfile builds
- [ ] Compose runs
- [ ] Notes written

## Next steps

- Add a health check route.
- Log one failure and the fix.
- Keep the stack small.

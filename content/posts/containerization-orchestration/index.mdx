This is a lab guide, not a production guide.

I use containers to learn reproducible builds and small service wiring.

You will build, run, verify, and clean up a tiny stack.

If you are new to Docker, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, containers package an app with its dependencies.

Low level, a Dockerfile builds an image and Docker Compose runs services together.

Key terms:

- **Image**: a snapshot of an app and its dependencies.
- **Container**: a running instance of an image.
- **Compose**: a YAML file that runs multiple containers.

## What you need

- Docker Desktop installed.
- A simple app folder.
- A terminal.

Docs used:

- https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
- https://docs.docker.com/compose/

## Start to finish

1) Create a Dockerfile.

Why: The Dockerfile tells Docker how to build your image.

Example:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

2) Build the image.

Why: You need a built image before you can run it.

```bash
docker build -t demo-app .
```

3) Run the container.

Why: This proves the image works.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 demo-app
```

4) Add Compose if you need a database.

Why: Compose makes multi-service setups simple.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

5) Run Compose.

```bash
docker compose up
```

6) Clean up.

Why: Stopping containers avoids accidental costs and clutter.

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Verify it worked

- You can reach the app at http://localhost:3000
- Containers show as running in Docker Desktop
- Logs show the app started without errors

If the container exits, check the logs:

```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Build fails on npm install.
  **Cause**: Missing package-lock.json.
  **Fix**: Copy it into the image or use npm install.

- **Symptom**: Port not reachable.
  **Cause**: Port mapping missing.
  **Fix**: Use -p 3000:3000 in docker run.

- **Symptom**: Compose fails.
  **Cause**: YAML indentation errors.
  **Fix**: Re-check spaces and alignment.

## Cheat sheet

- Dockerfile builds the image.
- docker build creates the image.
- docker run starts one container.
- docker compose runs multiple services.
- docker compose down stops them.

## Next steps

- Add a health check route.
- Add a small .env file and load it.
- Write short notes for the lab.

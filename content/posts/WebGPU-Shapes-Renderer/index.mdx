Hey, I’m Brad. I forked this WebGPU Shapes Renderer project called `leaf-js` from [deondreE/leaf-js](https://github.com/deondreE/leaf-js) for a class at Full Sail University (where I’m finishing my web dev degree, Aug 2023 - Oct 2025, 3.85 GPA). I didn’t build the core stuff—that’s all deondreE’s work. I just made a front-end to display the shapes and played around to learn WebGPU and how their library works. It draws shapes like triangles and squares on a canvas using WebGPU, and I added some tweaks with JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. Here’s why I did it, what I messed with, and what I learned. You can see it live at [bradleymatera.github.io/leaf-js/](https://bradleymatera.github.io/leaf-js/) or on my fork at [github.com/BradleyMatera/leaf-js/tree/buildingshapes](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/leaf-js/tree/buildingshapes).

### Why I Forked It
I’d never touched WebGPU before—it’s this new thing for browser graphics, faster than WebGL, and I wanted to learn it. The original `leaf-js` by deondreE had the heavy lifting done: WebGPU setup, shaders, rendering pipelines. I wasn’t ready to build that myself, so I forked it to study how it works. My class project was about experimenting with a new library, and I picked this because I like visuals—shapes sounded fun. I didn’t contribute back to the original author; this was just me messing around to learn, not to make something new for them.

### What I Did: Building a Front-End
The original project rendered shapes, but you had to uncomment code in `main.ts` to switch between them—like `initTriangle()` or `initSquare()`. I wanted to make it easier to see all the shapes without digging into the code, so I built a front-end in `index.html`. I added a dropdown to pick shapes and styled it with Tailwind CSS. Here’s what I started with:
```html
<select id="shape-selector" class="p-2 border rounded bg-gray-100">
  <option value="triangle">Triangle</option>
  <option value="square">Square</option>
  <option value="pentagon">Pentagon</option>
  <option value="diamond">Diamond</option>
  <option value="hexagon">Hexagon</option>
</select>
<canvas id="canvas" class="w-full h-96 border"></canvas>
```
I tied it to the library’s code in `main.ts` by mapping the dropdown to the shape functions:
```javascript
import initTriangle from './test-triangle';
import initSquare from './test-square';
import initPentagon from './test-pentagon';
import initDiamond from './test-diamond';
import initHexagon from './test-hexagon';

const shapes = {
  triangle: initTriangle,
  square: initSquare,
  pentagon: initPentagon,
  diamond: initDiamond,
  hexagon: initHexagon,
};

const selector = document.getElementById('shape-selector');
selector.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  const context = canvas.getContext('webgpu');
  const device = navigator.gpu.requestAdapter().then(adapter => adapter.requestDevice());
  shapes[e.target.value](context, device);
});
```
I tested it—picked "diamond," but it looked off, like squished. Turns out the vertex shader (`diamond.vert.wgsl`) had weird coordinates. I didn’t fix the shader (that’s deondreE’s code), but I logged the vertices to understand them:
```wgsl
var pos = array<vec2<f32>, 4>(
  vec2(0.0, 0.5),  // Top
  vec2(-0.5, 0.0), // Left
  vec2(0.0, -0.5), // Bottom
  vec2(0.5, 0.0)   // Right
);
```
I saw the issue—uneven spacing—but left it as-is to focus on my front-end.

### Learning the Library
The whole point was to figure out how `leaf-js` works. I dug into the shaders—like `triangle.vert.wgsl`—and saw how WebGPU uses WGSL (kinda like GLSL but with math tweaks):
```wgsl
@vertex
fn main(@builtin(vertex_index) VertexIndex: u32) -> @builtin(position) vec4<f32> {
  var pos = array<vec2<f32>, 3>(
    vec2(0.0, 0.5),  // Top
    vec2(-0.5, -0.5), // Bottom left
    vec2(0.5, -0.5)  // Bottom right
  );
  return vec4<f32>(pos[VertexIndex], 0.0, 1.0);
}
```
I learned that WebGPU maps these points to the canvas—`vec4` sets the position, and the fragment shader (`red.frag.wgsl`) colors it. I broke it by changing `0.5` to `2.0`—the triangle flew off-screen, which taught me the -1.0 to 1.0 range.

I also studied the render pipeline in `test-triangle.ts`:
```javascript
const pipeline = device.createRenderPipeline({
  vertex: {
    module: device.createShaderModule({ code: shapeVertWGSL }),
    entryPoint: 'main',
  },
  fragment: {
    module: device.createShaderModule({ code: fragWGSL }),
    entryPoint: 'main',
    targets: [{ format: presentationFormat }],
  },
  primitive: { topology: 'triangle-list' },
});
```
This showed me how WebGPU sets up drawing—way lower-level than Canvas or WebGL. I tested it by switching `triangle-list` to `line-list`—got lines instead of a filled shape, which was cool to see.

### Adding My Tweaks
Besides the dropdown, I made it more usable:
- **Responsive Design**: Used Tailwind to make the canvas fit any screen—`w-full h-96`—and tested it on my phone. Fixed a stretch issue with `max-w-full`.
- **Accessibility**: Added ARIA labels to the dropdown:
  ```html
  <select id="shape-selector" aria-label="Select a shape to render">
  ```
  Tested with my keyboard—worked fine after I added `tabindex="0"`.
- **Deployment**: Set up GitHub Pages with a workflow in `.github/workflows/`. Tested the live site—shapes loaded, but the canvas flickered on mobile. Didn’t fix that yet.

### What I Learned
This was all about learning for me, not building something new. Here’s what I got:
- **WebGPU Basics**: It’s faster than WebGL because it’s closer to the GPU—learned that from the pipeline setup and WGSL shaders. Breaking the topology helped me see how shapes are drawn.
- **Library Structure**: `leaf-js` taught me how to organize a renderer—shaders in one folder, init logic in another. I’d never seen that before.
- **Front-End Stuff**: I got better at Tailwind—`grid`, `p-2`, `bg-gray-100`—and tested responsive layouts. Accessibility was new too; ARIA labels make sense now.
- **Testing**: I broke stuff on purpose—like changing coordinates or topology—to see what happens. Found that diamond glitch but learned more by leaving it and studying why.

It’s not perfect—I didn’t touch the core library or fix bugs like the mobile flicker. But I had fun messing with it, and I get WebGPU a bit better now.

### Why It Matters
I’m not a graphics pro—this was me dipping my toes into WebGPU and learning a library by poking at it. It’s a small step, but it’s how I learn: build, break, fix, repeat. Maybe I’ll dig deeper into WebGPU later—add my own shapes or fix that flicker—but for now, it’s a solid start.

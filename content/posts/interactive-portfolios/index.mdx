Portfolios should be readable first, flashy second.

This post shows how to build a small interactive portfolio without breaking clarity.

You will set up a basic structure, add one interactive section, and verify accessibility.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- build a simple portfolio structure
- add one interactive section without hiding content
- verify that a recruiter can scan it fast

> "If the content is not readable without motion, it is not ready."

## What this is

**High level:** An interactive portfolio is a normal portfolio with small enhancements like animation or toggles.

**Low level:** You keep the core HTML readable, then add a small JavaScript layer that does not hide content.

**Key terms:**

- **Skip link:** A link that jumps to the main content for keyboard users.
- **CTA:** The main action you want a reader to take.
- **Progressive enhancement:** Adding JS only after the core page works.

## What you need

- A folder for your site
- A simple web server (optional)
- A text editor

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create the base HTML
Goal:
Create a clean, readable structure with headings and sections.

Actions:
- File path: `index.html`
- Add:
  ```html
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <title>Bradley Matera - Portfolio</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <a class="skip-link" href="#main">Skip to content</a>
      <header>
        <h1>Bradley Matera</h1>
        <p>Systems minded software engineer.</p>
      </header>
      <main id="main">
        <section>
          <h2>Projects</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>AnimalSounds</li>
            <li>WebGPU Triangle Demo</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Contact</h2>
          <p>Email: bradmatera@gmail.com</p>
        </section>
      </main>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

Why:
This is the readable core. Headings give structure for scanning. A skip link is a basic accessibility requirement. The portfolio should be usable even with no CSS. This also makes the interactive layer optional.

Verify:
- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- Expected: readable text with a working skip link.
- This confirms the base page works.

If it fails:
- Symptom: skip link does nothing.
- Fix: ensure the `main` element has `id="main"`.

### Step 2: Add a small interactive section
Goal:
Add one interactive panel without hiding essential content.

Actions:
- File path: `index.html`
- Add after Projects:
  ```html
  <section>
    <h2>Focus</h2>
    <button id="toggle">Show focus areas</button>
    <ul id="focus" hidden>
      <li>Clear documentation</li>
      <li>Repeatable deploys</li>
      <li>Honest demos</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <script>
    const button = document.getElementById("toggle");
    const list = document.getElementById("focus");
    button.addEventListener("click", () => {
      list.hidden = !list.hidden;
      button.textContent = list.hidden ? "Show focus areas" : "Hide focus areas";
    });
  </script>
  ```

Why:
A small toggle is enough to make the page feel interactive. Keeping the content in the DOM means it can still be read. This avoids hiding critical information from search and screen readers. The toggle is a safe, low risk interaction.

Verify:
- Click the button.
- Expected: the list shows and hides.
- This confirms the interaction works.

If it fails:
- Symptom: button does nothing.
- Fix: ensure the element IDs match the script.

### Step 3: Add basic styling
Goal:
Make the layout readable without overpowering the content.

Actions:
- File path: `styles.css`
- Add:
  ```css
  body { font-family: system-ui, sans-serif; max-width: 60ch; margin: 2rem auto; line-height: 1.6; }
  .skip-link { position: absolute; left: -999px; }
  .skip-link:focus { left: 1rem; background: #000; color: #fff; padding: 0.5rem; }
  ```
- Link it in `index.html`:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  ```

Why:
Readable line length matters more than effects. The skip link styles make keyboard navigation visible. This keeps the page accessible while still being clean. The styles stay minimal.

Verify:
- Reload the page.
- Expected: text is centered and readable.
- This confirms CSS is applied.

If it fails:
- Symptom: no styling applied.
- Fix: ensure the CSS file name matches the link.

## Verify it worked

- The page reads fine without JavaScript.
- The toggle works when JavaScript is enabled.
- The skip link is visible on focus.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Interactive section hides important info.  
  **Cause:** You moved core content into a toggle.  
  **Fix:** Keep core content visible and use toggles for extras.

- **Symptom:** Page feels cluttered.  
  **Cause:** Too many animations.  
  **Fix:** Keep one or two small interactions.

- **Symptom:** Skip link does not work.  
  **Cause:** Missing target ID.  
  **Fix:** Add `id="main"` to the main element.

## Cheat sheet

- Build a readable HTML base first.
- Add one small interaction.
- Keep core content visible.
- Verify keyboard navigation.

## Next steps

- Add a projects page with case studies.
- Add a single featured project section.
- Add a contact form if needed.

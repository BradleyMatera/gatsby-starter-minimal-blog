Interactive portfolios can help, but only if they stay readable.

This post is a full guide to balancing motion with clarity and proof.

You will get the structure, the steps, and the mistakes to avoid.

If you are building a portfolio site, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a content and UX guide for portfolio sites.

Low level, it is a layout checklist and proof link process.

Key terms:

- **Proof link**: a repo or demo URL that backs a claim.
- **CTA**: a clear action like “View demo” or “Read case study.”
- **Reality snapshot**: a short list of limits and gaps.

## What you need

- A list of projects.
- A demo link for each project.
- A short summary for each project.

## Start to finish

1) Write a one sentence summary for each project.

Why: Readers scan fast.

2) Add proof links.

Why: Claims need evidence.

3) Keep motion limited.

Why: Motion should support, not block.

4) Add a reality snapshot where needed.

Why: Honest limits build trust.

### Example project block

```md
Problem: one sentence
Solution: one sentence
Proof: repo and demo
Limits: one sentence
```

## Verify it worked

- The homepage explains what you do in one sentence.
- Each project has a repo or demo link.
- No section hides the main content.

If a project has no proof link, remove it.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Visitors get lost.
  **Cause**: Over-designed nav.
  **Fix**: Keep the nav simple and visible.

- **Symptom**: Claims feel inflated.
  **Cause**: No proof links.
  **Fix**: Add the repo or demo.

- **Symptom**: Too much motion.
  **Cause**: Multiple animated sections.
  **Fix**: Keep motion to one or two areas.

## Cheat sheet

- Clear summary first.
- Proof link for every claim.
- Motion stays minimal.
- Limits are visible.

## Next steps

- Audit your site in 10 minutes.
- Remove one unverified claim.
- Add one missing proof link.

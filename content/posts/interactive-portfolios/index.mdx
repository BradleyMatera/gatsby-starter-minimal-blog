## Introduction

I love building playful demos—single-page resumes with animated timelines, WebGPU canvases, and embedded code samples. They showcase technical range, but I learned the hard way that not every recruiter wants to explore an interactive playground. Many still expect a concise PDF and quick access to core qualifications. This post outlines how I balance both worlds: delighting curious reviewers without alienating busy hiring teams.

## Why Interactive Experiences Still Matter

- **Demonstrate front-end skills.** Interactive portfolios prove you can craft UI/UX, handle accessibility, and ship polished experiences.  
- **Tell richer stories.** Animations and embedded demos make it easier to highlight outcomes, not just bullet points.  
- **Stand out in niche roles.** Design, creative technology, and graphics positions often appreciate bespoke presentations.[^visualcv]

## Common Pitfalls

- **Maintenance overhead.** Interactive resumes require updates with every job change. Neglected demos hurt credibility.  
- **ATS incompatibility.** Applicant tracking systems rarely parse single-page apps, so a plain PDF is still necessary.[^the-muse]  
- **Accessibility gaps.** Fancy animation without keyboard support or alt text sends the wrong signal.  
- **Decision fatigue.** Too many clickable elements can overwhelm a recruiter who just wants contact info and experience.

## My Dual-Track Approach

| Asset | Purpose | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PDF résumé | ATS submission, quick review | One page, role-focused bullet points, quantifiable metrics. |
| Interactive SPA | Portfolio deep dive | Animated sections, live demos, CTA to download the PDF, analytics instrumentation. |
| Blog case studies | Context | Narrative breakdowns with architecture diagrams and lessons learned. |

Every job application includes the PDF and a link to the interactive experience. The SPA explicitly states that the PDF remains the canonical résumé, and call-to-action buttons surface it within one click.

## Designing Interactives with Recruiters in Mind

1. **Prioritise navigation.** Sticky menus, skip links, and jump-to-section buttons make it easy to skim.  
2. **Provide accessibility affordances.** Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, reduced motion settings, and high-contrast themes demonstrate empathy.  
3. **Instrument usage.** Lightweight analytics show which sections get attention; I adjust layout accordingly.  
4. **Offer context for each demo.** Explain the technology, problem solved, and role played so visitors are not guessing.  
5. **Allow printing.** Custom CSS ensures the SPA renders cleanly when printed or saved as PDF.

## When to Iterate or Retire a Demo

- **Outdated tech stack.** If a project highlights libraries I no longer use, I archive it or append a note describing what I would do differently today.  
- **Unclear value.** If analytics show a section has high exit rates, I either refine it or remove it.  
- **Recruiter feedback.** After informational interviews, I update sections recruiters found confusing (for example, reducing jargon in tooltips).

## Best Practices Checklist

- Provide a PDF fallback and make it prominent.  
- Include contact details in the first view—do not bury them behind animation.  
- Document when the portfolio was last updated.  
- Optimise load times; a sluggish SPA undermines the point.  
- Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

## Conclusion

Interactive portfolios should amplify your story, not replace essential materials. By pairing polished demos with accessible design and recruiter-friendly PDFs, you can showcase creativity while respecting hiring workflows. Treat every interactive element as evidence of skill, backed by measurable outcomes and easy navigation.

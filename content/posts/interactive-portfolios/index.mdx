> **Context:** I maintain two public portfolios—the live Gatsby/Netlify site you’re reading and a semantic GitHub Pages demo—and still send a PDF for every application.  
> **AI assist:** Drafted with ChatGPT using my recruiter conversations + analytics logs; edited on 2025-10-15.  
> **Status:** Advice from a job seeker who hasn’t been paid as a full-time web dev yet, so treat this as peer notes, not gospel.

## TL;DR

- **Interactive portfolios showcase craft, but recruiters still need fast answers.** Pair demos with a clear PDF so nobody hunts for basics.  
- **Treat experiences like products.** Maintain them, test accessibility, and track engagement to know what resonates.  
- **Make navigation obvious.** Sticky menus, skip links, and CTA buttons reduce friction for busy hiring teams.  
- **Retire outdated work.** Let analytics and recruiter feedback drive updates.

## Why Interactive Experiences Matter

- Demonstrate UI/UX, animation, and accessibility skills in context.  
- Tell richer stories with embedded demos and outcome-driven visuals.  
- Stand out in creative or graphics-heavy roles where bespoke presentations are valued [^visualcv].

## Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Maintenance drag:** Neglected demos signal stale skills.  
- **ATS friction:** Most systems cannot parse SPAs, so a PDF résumé remains mandatory [^the-muse].  
- **Accessibility misses:** Lack of keyboard support or alt text undermines credibility.  
- **Decision fatigue:** Overly complex navigation slows reviewers hunting for contact info.

## My Dual-Track Strategy

- **PDF résumé:** One-page, metric-driven summary built for ATS ingestion and quick scans.  
- **Interactive SPA:** Deep dive with animations, live demos, analytics, and the PDF surfaced in a single click.  
- **Blog case studies:** Narrative breakdowns with architecture diagrams, responsibilities, and lessons learned.

Every application includes the PDF and a link to the interactive experience; the SPA labels the PDF as canonical and keeps the download button persistent.

## Design Principles for Recruiter-Friendly Interactives

1. Prioritise navigation with sticky menus, skip links, and jump buttons.  
2. Invest in accessibility (semantic HTML, ARIA, reduced motion, contrast).  
3. Instrument usage to see what sections land.  
4. Add context to each demo—problem, role, tech stack, outcome.  
5. Provide print styles so the page exports cleanly.

## When to Iterate or Retire Demos

- Archive projects that showcase outdated stacks or add guidance about modern replacements.  
- Rework sections with high exit rates; simplify if analytics show drop-off.  
- Incorporate recruiter feedback immediately (e.g., clarify jargon-laden tooltips).

## Best-Practices Checklist

- Prominent PDF fallback and contact info above the fold.  
- Visible “last updated” timestamp to prove freshness.  
- Optimised load times and image compression.  
- Screen reader and keyboard-only testing before publishing.  
- Performance budgets for heavy animation or 3D elements.

## Key Takeaways

- **Blend delight with pragmatism.** Interactive storytelling should enhance, not replace, traditional résumé workflows.  
- **Measure and adapt.** Analytics and conversations with recruiters guide iteration.  
- **Ship with empathy.** Accessibility, quick navigation, and clear CTAs respect the audience’s time.

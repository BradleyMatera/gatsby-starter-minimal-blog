description: "How I keep an interactive portfolio honest—PDF résumé, SPA experience, analytics, and the guardrails that keep recruiters happy."
theme: "Front-End & Full-Stack"

> **Context:** I run two public portfolios: this Gatsby/Netlify site (case studies, honesty logs) and a lighter semantic template on GitHub Pages. Every application still includes a PDF résumé.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT summarized recruiter conversations and analytics excerpts; I edited the tone and numbers to match my actual dashboards.  
> **Status:** Advice from someone still job hunting. Use it as peer notes, not a definitive playbook.

## Reality snapshot

- Recruiters and hiring managers consistently ask for a PDF first. Interactive sites are “nice to have” once they’ve skimmed the basics.  
- My Netlify analytics show average session length ~2m15s. Most visitors read the hero + first project, maybe one blog post, then bounce.  
- Accessibility is non-negotiable: skip links, focus outlines, alt text, and a big “Download PDF résumé” button near the top.

## Dual-track setup

| Asset | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PDF résumé** | ATS-friendly, 1 page (bullets, measurable outcomes). | Updated monthly. Stored in `/static/BradleyMatera-Resume.pdf` with a visible timestamp. |
| **Interactive SPA** | Deep dive with honesty logs, case studies, live demos. | Gatsby on Netlify, content stored in MDX so I can diff claims. |
| **Semantic template** | Lightweight version (HTML/CSS/JS) on GitHub Pages. | Useful for recruiters who block heavy JS. Links straight back here. |

Every job application gets both: PDF in the ATS, SPA link in the cover letter or “Additional Materials” field.

## Design + honesty principles

1. **Navigation clarity:** Sticky nav, skip links, and CTA buttons (“Contact”, “Download PDF”) at the top.  
2. **Accessibility:** axe + Lighthouse scans on each deploy, manual keyboard + screen reader pass.  
3. **Reality blocks:** Every project/blog post starts with context + AI disclosure so visitors know what’s real.  
4. **Analytics + feedback:** Netlify analytics + LinkedIn DMs from recruiters drive my backlog (e.g., one DM prompted a bigger “Download PDF” button).  
5. **Changelog:** `honesty.md` logs every copy update with dates + rationale. The homepage shows “Last honesty update” so readers know the site isn’t stale.

## When I iterate or retire content

- If analytics show high exit rates on a section (>60% drop), I rewrite or remove it. Example: I trimmed the old “Mission” fluff because nobody scrolled past it.  
- If a project becomes misleading (Car-Match before it had a live backend), I add disclaimers or demote it until the copy matches reality.  
- When recruiters ask for clarity (“Is Triangle Shader Lab your framework?”), I update the site immediately so the next visitor isn’t confused.

## Checklists I run before sharing the SPA

- [ ] PDF résumé link visible in hero + footer.  
- [ ] All outbound proof links (GitHub PRs, Render demos, CodePens) open in new tabs and include context.  
- [ ] Accessibility audit: axe zero critical issues, manual keyboard walkthrough recorded.  
- [ ] Netlify deploy log clean (no warnings about sharp, images, etc.).  
- [ ] Honesty log updated with what changed (date, summary).

## Lessons so far

- **Interactive ≠ replacement.** Recruiters still skim the PDF first. The SPA is a guided tour for those who want more context.  
- **Maintenance beats novelty.** A static, honest site beats a flashy but broken experience.  
- **Share proof.** Every claim links to a repo, PR, or log. If the link breaks, the claim goes with it.  
- **Listen to feedback.** When hiring managers say “I couldn’t find X,” I fix it and note the change in `honesty.md`.

## Real recruiter feedback (and what I did)

- “Couldn’t find your PDF.” → Added a red “Download PDF résumé” button in the hero and footer.  
- “Too much JS; page felt heavy.” → Built the semantic HTML/CSS fallback and linked it in the nav.  
- “Which projects are real vs. labs?” → Added “Reality snapshot” + AI disclosure atop every case study.  
- “Links 404 on mobile VPN.” → Prefixed all internal links correctly and added status badges to demos (up/down/slow).

## How I measure if the site is working

- **Analytics:** Track scroll depth and exit rates. If a project card has high exits, I rewrite or move it lower.  
- **Speed:** Lighthouse scores stay in the high 90s; bundle size monitored on each deploy.  
- **Engagement:** Count clicks on “Contact” + PDF downloads after each update to see if changes help.  
- **Honesty velocity:** `honesty.md` updates at least monthly; if it’s stale, I question whether the site is.

## Playbook before a job application

- Update résumé date, regenerate PDF, and verify the link.  
- Ensure top 3 projects have working demos + screenshots + proof links.  
- Add a short “Why I’m applying” blurb to the homepage (temporary, removed after the cycle).  
- Check dark mode readability and mobile nav; recruiters often open on phones.

## Open questions I’m still testing

- Whether to add a 60-second Loom walkthrough or if that adds friction.  
- How much animation is acceptable before it distracts from content.  
- Best way to surface “what changed” without making the homepage feel like a changelog.  
- Whether to auto-detect ATS bots and serve the semantic version first.

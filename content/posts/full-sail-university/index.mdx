This is not a promo post. It is a reality check.

Full Sail gave me reps and structure. It did not give me production ownership.

You will get the real takeaways and a checklist I use to keep learning.

## The promise

You will learn:

- what the program trained well
- what it did not cover
- how I filled the gaps

> "School gave me reps. The rest is on me."

## What the program did well

- Short cycles that forced shipping.
- Frequent feedback.
- Clear rubrics.

### Example weekly note

```text
What shipped:
What failed:
What I will fix next:
```

## Signature projects and evidence

- AWS internship capstone notes
- CheeseMath testing demo
- Triangle WebGPU demo

## CTA: Open the notes

## What it did not cover

- Production-scale systems
- Long-term ownership
- Deep CS theory

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick one gap.
2. Build a small demo around it.
3. Write a short retro.

### Common mistakes

- Expecting school to replace practice.
- Skipping review notes.
- Chasing too many tools at once.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] One gap chosen
- [ ] One demo shipped
- [ ] One retro written

## Next steps

- Keep one active lab per month.
- Rotate focus areas quarterly.
- Save your notes.

> **Context:** Finished Full Sail’s Web Development B.S. in October 2025 (GPA ~3.8). Still looking for my first paid SWE role.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped reorganize my notes; I cross-checked with syllabi/transcripts.  
> **Status:** Honest recap, not an attempt to inflate coursework into production experience.

## Program snapshot

Full Sail’s Web Development program moves fast. Everything is built around four-week sprints—controlled chaos with a deadline. You focus on **one course at a time**, but each month hits like its own bootcamp.

- **Format:** 4-week sprints with rotating instructors and rubrics.  
- **Schedule:** Workload shifted constantly—some weeks light, others unexpectedly heavy.  
- **Deliverables:** Working build, documentation, rubric checklist, and a retro or reflection.  
- **Grading weight:** Docs/presentation quality mattered almost as much as code.  

## Course areas that shaped me the most

Full Sail’s titles shifted over time and instructors ran things differently, so grouping by area is more honest than listing exact course names.

| Course area | Key deliverable | Skills reinforced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full-stack project cycles (Project & Portfolio) | Building and iterating on a React + Node app each month | Iteration, planning, accepting critique, demoing unfinished work with confidence |
| Server-side development | REST APIs, templating, session-based auth in Node/PHP | Routing, state handling, error patterns, readable backend structure |
| Cloud and application deployment | AWS Academy labs with services like Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, CloudWatch (sandbox depth) | Basic cloud mental models, logging, monitoring, cost awareness, rollback habits |
| Systems and configuration basics | Linux permissions, basic Nginx concepts, small automation scripts | Ops hygiene, troubleshooting steps, repeatable checklists, scripting discipline |
| Human-Computer Interaction & UX | Usability testing, accessibility checks, persona-driven design exercises | UX empathy, accessibility awareness, clearer communication with non-technical people |

## Signature projects & evidence

### Capstone: Car-Match (personal learning project)
- **Stack:** React, Node.js/Express, MongoDB Atlas, Render (backend), GitHub Pages (frontend)  
- **Reality:** End-to-end matching prototype I built myself. Handles auth, profiles, uploads, scoring, and real-time updates once the backend wakes up. Runs on free-tier infra, so I classify it as a learning project—not production.  
- Repo + demo: https://github.com/BradleyMatera/car-match

### Other projects that shaped my learning
- **Interactive Pokédex:** API-driven search, cards, error states, responsive layout. Demo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/Interactive-Pokedex/  
- **AnimalSounds:** Next.js App Router soundboard with offline-ready audio, keyboard-friendly interactions, and local favorites. Demo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/AnimalSounds/  
- **Professional Portfolio Website:** Hand-built portfolio (no template). Demo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/Professional-Portfolio-Website/  
- **CheeseMath (Jest Tests):** Tiny math utility to learn unit testing/mocking/CI. Demo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests/  
- **Triangle WebGPU Demo:** First graphics experiment; learned the pipeline and debugging GPU errors. Demo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/TriangleDemo/  
- **Ethics Engine Frontend Demo:** Rule-based decision UI prototype. Demo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/EthicsFrontEndDemo/

### Server Management Lab
Covered Linux hardening, Nginx basics, and bash automation. I didn’t build full AWS pipelines there; most of my ops habits came later from personal projects and the AWS internship.

### Communication touchpoints
This was a remote program. I didn’t do weekly stand-ups with classmates. Most “comms practice” came from Tech Talk (an after-class group) and occasional Q&A with instructors. The status-report style in my repos is a personal habit, not from formal stand-ups.

## Habits I carried forward

- **Sprint rhythm:** Intake → prototype → critique → iterate → deliver.  
- **Docs before code:** Clarity, diagrams, tests, deploy notes, retro—no “done” without docs.  
- **Feedback resilience:** Frequent scope pivots desensitized me to change.  
- **Honesty logs:** Every project tracks what’s done, broken, and next.

## Beyond coursework

- **AWS Cloud Support Internship:** Concepts at school; reality at AWS—log hunting, broken infra diagnosis under time pressure.  
- **Community involvement:** CIRIS docs, Tech Talk Club, alumni Q&A, small OSS fixes.  
- **Personal experiments:** WebGPU shaders and Zig parsers filled curriculum gaps and showed where academics stop and the real world begins.

## What the program didn’t cover (well)

- Deep CS theory (algorithms, data structures beyond basics).  
- Production-scale DevOps (multi-account AWS, Terraform modules, blast radius).  
- Real on-call culture—no paging, SLAs, or incident triage.  
- System design beyond small apps.  
- I compensate with LeetCode, cloud labs, ACloudGuru, personal projects, and the internship.

## A week-in-the-life during a sprint

There was no single “normal week.” Each course had its own rhythm. The consistent anchors:

- **Weekly project due Sunday**  
- **If discussions existed:** initial post Thursday, two replies Sunday

Everything else moved. Some weeks felt like lightweight labs; others like a four-week hackathon squeezed into six days. Rubrics sometimes contradicted themselves. The real skill was adjusting, interpreting, and self-organizing.

- **Early-week orientation:** Rubric drops, announcements, decoding expectations (every instructor interpreted rubrics differently).  
- **Mid-week chaos (or silence):** Could be UI flows, backend logic, DB schema, AWS lab, accessibility review, or waiting for clarifications.  
- **Late-week push (Thu–Sun):** Partners available, critiques posted, requirements clarified—prototypes became real builds.  
- **Sunday crunch:** Final packaging, retros, last-second fixes, demos, screenshots, README tweaks. Most submissions landed in a 6–10 hour window before 11:59 PM ET.

Bottom line: no ritual Monday–Friday—only adaptation, deadlines, and evidence. That forced me to build my own systems for consistency and delivery.

## Mistakes I made (and fixed) — the real list

- **Building the whole idea instead of the assignment:** I’d architect like it was a startup app and chase features no one graded. Fix: work backward from the rubric and ship faster.  
- **Over-researching instead of starting:** I’d read docs, overthink tooling, and delay writing code. Fix: prototype early, even if rough—speed doubled once something existed.  
- **Light Git/GitHub use early on:** Forgot to commit/branch and lost work. Fix: proper commits/branches became natural once projects grew (Car-Match).  
- **Letting vague rubrics stall me:** I’d wait for clarification and lose days. Fix: make assumptions, document them, and move.  
- **Underestimating “simple” tasks:** UI, APIs, deploys, and auth always took longer. Fix: pad time and treat “simple” as “unknown.”  
- **Not testing on real devices:** Early projects broke on phones/tablets. Fix: test on mobile and use dev tools for responsiveness.  
- **Deploying last-minute:** Sunday-night deploys failed (cold starts, cache, env vars). Fix: deploy early/often—never first deploy on Sunday.  
- **Working solo by default:** In groups I’d carry too much. Fix: delegate by rubric items, set boundaries.  
- **Not documenting decisions:** Forgetting my own reasoning led to rework. Fix: write decisions while coding.  
- **Perfection before done:** Polished UI and rewrote working code needlessly. Fix: Done → Working → Better.  
- **Avoiding “boring” topics:** Accessibility, testing, comments, error messages, validation. Fix: school and Car-Match forced me to care.  
- **Trying to learn everything at once:** Spread too thin across front/back/cloud/devops/design. Fix: narrow focus to 1–2 skills per month and rotate.

## How I present this to employers

- This degree gave me **reps**, not production.  
- I pair each course with a link + one-sentence takeaway.  
- I’m explicit about gaps and how I’m closing them.  
- I show projects, runbooks, evidence, retros—not hype.

## Advice to future Full Sail students

- Treat rubrics like user stories—finish with evidence.  
- Keep a parking-lot list so you don’t chase stretch ideas mid-sprint.  
- Record Looms weekly; they save presentations.  
- Build one anchor project outside class to unify skills.

## Metrics and receipts

- ~20 projects shipped.  
- Every sprint: at least two critique loops.  
- GPA ~3.8; strongest in docs/presentations.  
- Post-grad: weekly code reviews with peers to keep cadence alive.

## Artifacts & links

Most portfolio/GitHub repos come from Full Sail work, but syllabi, rubrics, and runbooks are private or lost. If you want specific artifacts, I can share what I have privately.

## Key takeaways

- Formal education gave me structure, accountability, and reps presenting/defending work.  
- Side projects and internships are essential to stress-test those skills.  
- Full Sail drilled an honesty mindset: document what’s done, what’s broken, and what’s next—no fluff.

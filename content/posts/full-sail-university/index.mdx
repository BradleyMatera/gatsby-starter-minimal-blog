description: "Reflections on completing a B.S. in Web Development at Full Sail University and how its project-based curriculum sharpened my engineering habits."
---

> **Context:** Completed the B.S. in Web Development at Full Sail in October 2025; still early in my career and seeking my first full-time dev role.  
> **AI assist:** Draft inspired by ChatGPT summaries of my course notes; I reconciled it with actual syllabi + transcripts on 2025-10-15.  
> **Status:** Student reflection—not an attempt to inflate class projects into paid client work.

## TL;DR

- **Accelerated, project-based courses built momentum.** Every four-week sprint ended with a shipped deliverable and critique cycle.  
- **Documentation and collaboration became muscle memory.** Architecture diagrams, peer reviews, and demos were graded requirements.  
- **Signature projects mirrored real production work.** Capstone and server management labs introduced CI/CD, IaC, and hardening checklists.  
- **Formal training amplified—rather than replaced—internships and side projects.** School provided structure; industry work supplied scale.

## Program Snapshot

- **Degree:** B.S. in Web Development (graduated Oct 2025; GPA hovered around 3.8 per unofficial transcript).  
- **Cadence:** Four-week courses with deliverables and live defences.  
- **Mindset:** Justify architecture with user impact and operational reality every week.  
- **Reference:** Full Sail University, Web Development B.S. programme (2025).

## Curriculum Highlights

- **Project & Portfolio I–IV:** Built progressive full-stack apps, practised iterative design reviews, and presented to mock stakeholders.  
- **Server-Side Languages:** Delivered Node.js/PHP REST APIs with secure sessions and templating discipline.  
- **Cloud Application Development:** Deployed microservices to AWS, produced cost models, and shipped monitoring dashboards.  
- **Server Management & Configuration:** Completed Linux provisioning labs focused on bash, config management, and hardening.  
- **Capstone Project:** Scoped and defended an event management platform with cross-functional teammates.

## Habits That Stuck

- **Sprint rhythm:** Intake, prototype, critique, iterate, deliver—now the default cadence for side projects.  
- **Docs before code:** Required diagrams, test evidence, and deployment notes now inform internship and client handoffs.  
- **Collaboration rituals:** Stand-ups, pairing, and peer reviews built confidence joining professional agile teams.  
- **Feedback resilience:** Professor “product owners” normalised late-stage changes; feedback feels like a system upgrade, not a setback.

## Signature Projects

### Capstone: Event Ops Platform

- **Stack:** React, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  
- **Contributions:** Led backend design, implemented JWT auth, and built analytics dashboards.  
- **Reality:** Class-level MVP with CI/CD + IaC templates documented for review—helpful practice, not a production deployment.

### Server Management Lab

- Provisioned EC2 via CloudFormation, configured Nginx load balancing, and scripted blue/green deployments in a sandbox.  
- Hardened servers against CIS benchmarks and validated with automated compliance scans (per lab rubric).

## Beyond the Classroom

- **Internships:** AWS Cloud Support exposed enterprise-scale operations and ticket triage.  
- **Community work:** Open-source PRs and tech talks kept me collaborating outside coursework.  
- **Personal experiments:** Side projects with Zig and WebGPU filled curriculum gaps.

## Key Takeaways

- **Formal education builds foundational discipline.** Structured sprints, demos, and documentation habits carry into every project.  
- **Real-world practice completes the loop.** Internships and personal work stress-test classroom lessons at scale.  
- **Keep iterating.** Graduation marked the start of new experiments, not the end of learning.

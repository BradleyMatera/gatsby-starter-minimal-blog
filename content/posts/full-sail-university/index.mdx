This is a straight breakdown of what the program did and did not teach.

It is not a promo post. It is a clear list of reps and gaps.

You will get the structure, the gaps, and the practical steps I used to close them.

If you are choosing a program, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a summary of training plus a gap plan.

Low level, it is a list of skills, missing areas, and the steps I used to practice them.

Key terms:

- **Reps**: repeated practice that builds skill.
- **Gap**: a topic the program did not cover deeply.
- **Retro note**: a short summary of what worked and what did not.

## What you need

- A way to track notes.
- One small project outside class.
- A weekly review habit.

## Start to finish

1) Track weekly reps.

Why: You need a record of what you actually practiced.

2) List gaps every month.

Why: The gaps pile up fast if you do not name them.

3) Build one demo to close one gap.

Why: The demo is the proof that you learned it.

4) Write a short retro note.

Why: It helps you retain the lesson.

### Example retro note

```text
What I learned:
What I missed:
What I will practice next:
```

## Verify it worked

- You can explain the concept without notes.
- The demo runs without hidden setup.
- The retro note is short and clear.

If the demo does not run, the gap is still open.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Too many gaps at once.
  **Cause**: Trying to cover everything.
  **Fix**: Pick one gap per month.

- **Symptom**: Demos never ship.
  **Cause**: No weekly review.
  **Fix**: Add a short review block.

- **Symptom**: Notes disappear.
  **Cause**: No consistent storage.
  **Fix**: Keep notes in one place.

## Cheat sheet

- Track weekly reps.
- List gaps monthly.
- Ship one demo per gap.
- Write a short retro note.

## Next steps

- Choose one gap and build a demo this month.
- Add a short retro note to the demo README.

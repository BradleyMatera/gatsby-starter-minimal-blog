## Introduction

I finished my Bachelor of Science in Web Development at Full Sail University in October 2025 with a 3.8 GPA. The programme’s accelerated, project-based structure demanded consistent output—every four-week course ended with a shipped deliverable. That pace shaped how I plan features, collaborate under pressure, and reflect on my work. Here is how key classes influenced my engineering practice.

## Curriculum Highlights

| Course | Deliverable | Takeaways |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project & Portfolio I–IV | Progressive full-stack applications | Iterative design reviews, Git-based collaboration, and stakeholder presentations. |
| Server-Side Languages | REST API in Node.js and PHP | Emphasis on secure session management and templating. |
| Cloud Application Development | Deployed microservice to AWS | Infrastructure diagrams, cost modelling, and monitoring dashboards. |
| Server Management & Configuration | Linux provisioning labs | Bash scripting, configuration management, and hardening checklists. |
| Capstone Project | Event management platform | Cross-functional teamwork, product scoping, and final defence presentation. |

Full Sail’s instructors pushed us to justify architectural choices with user impact and operational considerations. We presented weekly demos, incorporated critiques, and resubmitted improvements—all under tight deadlines.

## Habits the Programme Reinforced

- **Working in sprints.** Each course mimicked a sprint cycle: requirements intake, prototype, critique, iterate, deliver. I now break side projects into the same cadence with demo checkpoints.  
- **Documentation-first thinking.** Lab reports and capstone deliverables required architecture diagrams, testing evidence, and deployment notes. I carried that mindset into internships, where clear docs accelerate handoffs.  
- **Collaboration rituals.** Pair programming, stand-ups, and peer reviews were built into the grading rubric. Practising these rituals in school made it natural to integrate into professional agile teams.  
- **Resilience under feedback.** Professors acted as product owners, asking for late-stage adjustments or refactors. Responding constructively taught me to view feedback as a path to better outcomes, not personal critique.

## Signature Projects

### Capstone: Event Ops Platform
- **Tech stack:** React, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  
- **Role:** Led backend design, implemented JWT-based authentication, and wrote analytics dashboards.  
- **Outcome:** Delivered a production-ready MVP with CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code templates, and accessibility audits.

### Server Management Lab
- Provisioned EC2 instances through CloudFormation, implemented Nginx load balancing, and scripted blue/green deployments.  
- Hardened instances using CIS Benchmarks and verified with automated compliance scans.

## Beyond the Classroom

Formal education was only one pillar. I supplemented coursework with:
- **Internships** (Amazon AWS Cloud Support) to see how enterprise-scale operations differ from classroom labs.  
- **Community contributions** (open-source PRs, tech talks) to stay grounded in real-world collaboration.  
- **Personal portfolio projects** to experiment with technologies not covered in the syllabus (Zig, WebGPU).

## Conclusion

Full Sail’s immersive schedule demanded discipline, teamwork, and reflective practice. The experience didn’t replace hands-on experimentation or industry exposure, but it gave me a strong foundation to build upon. Formal training taught me how to structure complex projects; internships and self-driven work taught me how to evolve them. Together they continue to shape the developer I am becoming.

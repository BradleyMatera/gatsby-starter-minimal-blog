Formal training only matters if you can reuse it in real projects.

This post shows what I kept from school, how I organize it, and how I verify it.

You will build a small structure to preserve course work and keep it honest.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- organize course projects with proof links
- capture one repeatable process you can use now
- avoid overstating what school covered

> "Keep the parts that still run and delete the rest."

## What this is

**High level:** This is a method for extracting useful habits from formal training.

**Low level:** You archive projects, add proof links, and write short notes about what the project does today.

**Key terms:**

- **Proof link:** A repo or live URL that shows the project works.
- **Archive:** A folder for old projects you no longer update.

## What you need

- A folder for archived projects
- A short README template
- One example project you can still run

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create an archive folder
Goal:
Store school projects in one place.

Actions:
- Command:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p school-projects/archive
  ```

Why:
A clean archive stops old projects from polluting your current work. It also makes the story clear. This is the first step to honest documentation. You can always delete what no longer works.

Verify:
- Run:
  ```bash
  ls school-projects
  ```
- Expected: `archive` folder.
- This confirms the structure is ready.

If it fails:
- Symptom: folder not found.
- Fix: re-run the `mkdir` command.

### Step 2: Add a short project README
Goal:
Document one project with a clear proof link.

Actions:
- File path: `school-projects/archive/project-name/README.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Project: Example Project
  Status: archived
  Proof link: https://github.com/yourname/project
  What still works: builds locally
  What does not: no live demo
  ```

Why:
This keeps the project honest. It shows what still runs and what does not. It also prevents vague claims. A short README is enough to be clear.

Verify:
- Open the README and confirm the proof link works.
- This confirms the project is documented.

If it fails:
- Symptom: no proof link.
- Fix: add the repo URL or remove the project.

### Step 3: Capture the reusable habit
Goal:
Write one habit you still use from training.

Actions:
- File path: `school-projects/habits.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Habit: small weekly deliverables
  How I use it now: weekly demo goals
  ```

Why:
The habit is the long term value. This turns education into a repeatable process. It also keeps the post grounded in what you actually do now. The habit should be specific and testable.

Verify:
- Open the file and confirm the habit is stated in one sentence.
- This confirms it is usable.

If it fails:
- Symptom: the habit is vague.
- Fix: rewrite it with a concrete example.

## Verify it worked

- Archive folder exists.
- One project has a README and proof link.
- One habit is documented.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Old projects are listed as current.  
  **Cause:** No archive or status note.  
  **Fix:** add a status line in README.

- **Symptom:** Claims do not match reality.  
  **Cause:** No proof link.  
  **Fix:** add a link or remove the claim.

- **Symptom:** The habit is abstract.  
  **Cause:** No concrete example.  
  **Fix:** add one real example.

## Cheat sheet

- Archive old projects.
- Add proof links.
- Keep one real habit.

## Next steps

- Move broken projects to archive.
- Keep only the ones you can still run.

## Final CTA

Keep the useful parts and cut the rest. That is the honest way to do this.

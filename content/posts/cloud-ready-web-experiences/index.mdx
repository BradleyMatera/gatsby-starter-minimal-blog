A launch checklist is only useful if you can run every line.

This post shows a small prelaunch checklist you can wire into any web project.

You will add scripts, a checklist file, and a few clear checks you can verify.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- add a real checklist file to your repo
- run three concrete checks before deploy
- document what you did and what you skipped

> "A short checklist you actually run beats a perfect checklist you ignore."

## What this is

**High level:** A prelaunch checklist is a short list of checks you run before publishing.

**Low level:** You add scripts, run commands, capture the output, and record any gaps.

**Key terms:**

- **Checklist:** A written list of checks you can repeat.
- **Build:** The process that turns source code into deployable output.
- **Smoke check:** A short manual pass of core flows.

## What you need

- A web repo with `package.json`
- A build command that works locally
- A place to store notes, like `docs/`

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create a checklist file
Goal:
Create a single source of truth for prelaunch checks.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/prelaunch-checklist.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Prelaunch checklist
  - Build passes locally
  - Lint passes locally
  - Core user flow smoke check
  - 404 page loads
  - Contact link works
  ```

Why:
A checklist is only real if it is written down. Keeping it in `docs/` makes it part of the repo. A short list is easier to keep up to date. This also gives you a place to track gaps later.

Verify:
- Run:
  ```bash
  cat docs/prelaunch-checklist.md
  ```
- Expected: the five lines above.
- This confirms the checklist exists.

If it fails:
- Symptom: file not found.
- Fix: create the `docs/` folder and add the file again.

### Step 2: Add scripts for build and lint
Goal:
Ensure build and lint commands exist and are consistent.

Actions:
- File path: `package.json`
- Add or confirm:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "your-build-command",
      "lint": "your-lint-command"
    }
  }
  ```
- Replace the placeholders with your real commands.

Why:
Scripts standardize how you run checks. This avoids “works on my machine” issues. It also keeps the checklist repeatable. A single entry point is the cleanest path to verification.

Verify:
- Run:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run lint
  ```
- Expected: both commands exit with code 0.
- This confirms the scripts are real.

If it fails:
- Symptom: script not found.
- Fix: update `package.json` with the correct command.

### Step 3: Add a smoke check note
Goal:
Document what you manually verify before publish.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/smoke-check.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Smoke check
  - Home page loads
  - Primary CTA works
  - One form submits
  ```

Why:
Manual checks are valid when written down. They help you catch UI regressions that automation does not cover. This also keeps your claims honest. If you did not check it, do not claim it.

Verify:
- Run the app and follow the list.
- Expected: each step works once.
- This confirms the smoke check is real.

If it fails:
- Symptom: you cannot reproduce the check.
- Fix: update the list to match what you actually tested.

## Verify it worked

- `docs/prelaunch-checklist.md` exists and is readable.
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` complete without errors.
- Smoke check steps are listed and verified manually.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Lint is skipped before deploy.  
  **Cause:** No lint script exists.  
  **Fix:** Add the script and run it once.

- **Symptom:** Checklist grows and stops being used.  
  **Cause:** Too many items.  
  **Fix:** Keep it under 10 items and cut anything not run.

- **Symptom:** Smoke checks are vague.  
  **Cause:** No specific steps.  
  **Fix:** Write three exact actions and confirm them.

## Cheat sheet

- Write the checklist.
- Add build and lint scripts.
- Run both commands.
- Do one smoke check and note it.

## Next steps

- Add a small release note file per deploy.
- Add a simple 404 test page check.
- Add one accessibility scan if your tools support it.

## Final CTA

Make the checklist short enough that you can finish it before every deploy.

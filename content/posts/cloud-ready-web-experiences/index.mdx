> **Context:** Personal checklist for the small demos I build (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Render)—I haven’t launched enterprise systems yet.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped structure this article; I filled it with the actual habits/tools I use today.  
> **Status:** Student perspective meant to keep me honest about what’s real vs. aspirational.

## TL;DR

- **Accessibility is the north star.** Semantic HTML, ARIA restraint, axe scans, and manual screen-reader passes keep even my tiny demos usable [^aria][^wcag].  
- **Cloud readiness (for me) = clean deploys + basic observability.** Netlify/GitHub Pages builds, environment docs, and sanity dashboards keep prototypes predictable [^well-architected].  
- **Resilience is rehearsed, even locally.** Feature flags, smoke tests, and backup scripts let me recover when something breaks—even if the audience is just me.  
- **Checklists prevent drift.** A pre-launch review covers accessibility, performance, reliability, security, and cost before publishing.

## Accessibility First

- **Semantic structure:** Reach for native elements (`nav`, `main`, `button`) and add ARIA only when the platform cannot express intent [^aria].  
- **Inclusive interactions:** Guarantee keyboard navigation, visible focus states, and descriptive alt/captions so the whole journey is explorable.  
- **Performance for everyone:** Trim bundles, minimise layout shifts, and respect `prefers-reduced-motion` so slower devices stay comfortable.

## Architect for Scale & Insight

- **Design stateless services:** Pair load balancers with external session stores (Redis, DynamoDB) for horizontal scaling.  
- **Commit infrastructure as code:** Use Terraform or CDK, version control templates, and review changes with the AWS Well-Architected lens [^well-architected].  
- **Instrument early:** Capture JSON logs, layer in OpenTelemetry traces, and define SLIs/SLOs before traffic spikes.

## Build for Resilience

- **Defensive coding:** Bake in retries, exponential backoff, and circuit breakers; run chaos experiments to validate assumptions.  
- **Progressive delivery:** Lean on feature flags, canaries, and automated rollbacks inside GitHub Actions.  
- **Disaster readiness:** Schedule snapshots, enable S3 versioning, and rehearse runbooks so recovery steps are muscle memory.

## Pre-Launch Checklist

- **Accessibility:** Logical heading order, screen-reader flow, and focus states verified.  
- **Performance:** Largest Contentful Paint meets targets; media optimised and cached.  
- **Reliability:** Post-deploy smoke tests automated; alerts mapped to actionable runbooks.  
- **Security:** Secrets tucked into Secrets Manager or GitHub; third-party scripts reviewed.  
- **Cost:** Budgets in place, alerts firing before spend spikes.

## Case Study: Interactive Pokédex (GitHub Pages demo)

- **Delivery:** Hosted on GitHub Pages with a lightweight caching layer (IndexedDB + `localStorage`)—no CloudFront yet.  
- **Security:** PokeAPI is public, so there are no secrets; I call it directly from the browser and document rate-limit handling.  
- **Accessibility:** Automated axe scans plus manual VoiceOver/keyboard passes before each publish.  
- **Observability:** DevTools + Netlify analytics (for the Gatsby site linking to it) show basic latency/error info; no CloudWatch dashboards in play yet.

## Key Takeaways

- **Accessibility, resilience, and scale reinforce each other.** Semantic choices often reduce bundle weight and ease scaling.  
- **Observability is table stakes.** Instrument everything before launch so future-you can troubleshoot.  
- **Test the safety nets.** Backups, rollbacks, and playbooks only work if you rehearse them.

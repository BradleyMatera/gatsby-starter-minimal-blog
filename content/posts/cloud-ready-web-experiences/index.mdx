Public demos can look polished and still be honest.

This post shows a full pre-launch workflow with setup, checks, and clean notes.

You will get the full sequence from setup to verification.

If you ship demos, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a pre-launch checklist for small demo sites.

Low level, it is a set of steps with verification and cleanup.

Key terms:

- **Demo**: a public project that proves a feature without full production scope.
- **Checklist**: a short list of checks you run before publishing.
- **Reality snapshot**: a short section that lists limits and gaps.

## What you need

- A deployed demo link.
- A README you can edit.
- A browser for checks.

## Start to finish

1) Review the main flow.

Why: You need the core experience to work before polish.

2) Check accessibility.

Why: A demo should still be usable.

3) Check links and errors.

Why: Broken links kill trust fast.

4) Add a reality snapshot.

Why: You must list limits clearly.

5) Re-test after edits.

Why: Changes can break working flows.

### Example reality snapshot

```md
## Reality snapshot
- What works
- What is missing
- What is planned
```

## Verify it worked

- The demo loads in a private window.
- Keyboard navigation works on key buttons.
- The reality snapshot matches the demo.

If a link fails, fix it before sharing.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Users report broken links.
  **Cause**: Links not checked after deploy.
  **Fix**: Click every link before publishing.

- **Symptom**: Accessibility regressions.
  **Cause**: New styles without contrast checks.
  **Fix**: Run a quick contrast review.

- **Symptom**: Confusing scope.
  **Cause**: No limits listed.
  **Fix**: Add a reality snapshot.

## Cheat sheet

- Test the main flow.
- Check accessibility.
- Fix links and errors.
- Write a reality snapshot.

## Next steps

- Add a small checklist to each demo README.
- Re-run the checklist before every share.

I ship small public demos. I treat them like products.

This post is the short checklist I use before I publish. It is not enterprise. It is just honest.

You will get the steps, the mistakes, and a template you can reuse.

## The promise

By the end, you will have:

- a pre-launch checklist
- a list of common mistakes
- a simple way to document limits

> "A demo is fine. A demo without notes is a trap."

## The checklist I run

### Accessibility

- Keyboard focus visible
- Color contrast checked
- Headings in order

### Reliability

- One basic smoke check
- Clear error states
- Links verified

### Honesty

- Limitations written down
- Missing features listed
- Tech stack is accurate

### Example note section

```md
## Reality snapshot
- What works
- What is missing
- What is planned
```

## CTA: Copy the checklist

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick one demo.
2. Run the checklist.
3. Write the reality snapshot.
4. Ship the update.

### Common mistakes

- Saying a demo is production-ready.
- Leaving broken links on the page.
- Hiding limits in the README only.

Tutorials are fine. Building is faster.

This post is a full method for learning by shipping small demos.

You will get the steps, the checks, and the mistakes to avoid.

If you learn best by doing, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a learning loop built around small projects.

Low level, it is a set of steps, a note template, and a verification checklist.

Key terms:

- **Demo**: a tiny project that proves one concept.
- **Learning loop**: repeatable steps that turn effort into skill.
- **Proof link**: a repo or demo URL that shows the work.

## What you need

- One small idea.
- A repo to publish.
- A short note template.

## Start to finish

1) Pick one concept.

Why: A single focus is easier to complete.

2) Write a one sentence goal.

Why: It keeps the demo small.

3) Build the smallest version.

Why: You need a working result fast.

4) Write a short note.

Why: The note is the real learning artifact.

5) Publish the link.

Why: A demo without a link is not verifiable.

### Example note template

```text
Goal:
What worked:
What failed:
What I learned:
```

## Verify it worked

- The demo runs locally.
- The demo runs from the live link.
- The note explains what is missing.

If you cannot reproduce it, rewrite the note.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Demo never ships.
  **Cause**: Scope too large.
  **Fix**: Cut it in half.

- **Symptom**: Notes are empty.
  **Cause**: Skipped reflection.
  **Fix**: Write three lines only.

- **Symptom**: Claims are vague.
  **Cause**: No proof link.
  **Fix**: Add the repo or demo link.

## Cheat sheet

- One concept.
- One sentence goal.
- One small demo.
- One short note.

## Next steps

- Ship one demo this week.
- Add a reality snapshot to the README.
- Share the link with one person.

description: "A field report on how I use CodePen to build muscle memory, where AI fits, what’s real, and what still breaks—GIFs included."
theme: "Front-End & Full-Stack"
---

> **Context:** CodePen is the sandbox where I learn in public while juggling school, family, and internship work. None of these pens are “products”—they’re reps.  
> **AI assist:** Copilot/ChatGPT help with scaffolds, regex, and wording. I note AI involvement on every pen.  
> **Status:** Learning log first, portfolio second. Expect rough edges and TODOs.

### TL;DR

- I start in CodePen because it is fast, safe to break, and easy to share.  
- AI gives me scaffolds; I supply constraints, debugging, and deploys.  
- Pens only graduate to repos when they are stable, accessible, and tested.  
- Every pen gets a “Reality” block, GIF, and backlog note to keep me honest.

## Where My Skills Actually Sit

- B.S. Web Development (Full Sail 2025) gave me HTML/CSS/JS fundamentals, starter React, a dash of Python/SQL, and UX basics.  
- Comfort zone: reading JS/React, tracing requests, wiring small APIs, and deploying to GitHub Pages/Netlify without fear.  
- Gaps: classic data structures/algorithms depth, writing everything from a blank file without references, and formal CS math.  
- AI’s role: accelerant, not autopilot. I still debug, decide scope, and wire deploys.
- Constraints: balancing family, internship work, and school means I need feedback loops that are short, cheap, and honest—hence CodePen.
- Taste: prioritize honest copy, realistic scopes, and receipts that survive interviews over “perfect” patterns.

---

## Why CodePen Is My Gym

- **Instant feedback:** No local setup; I can prototype an idea in minutes.  
- **Safe failure:** Breaking a pen doesn’t take down Netlify or a Render backend.  
- **Documentation:** Every pen description now includes a “Reality” block (what works, what doesn’t, what AI wrote).
- **Shareable receipts:** I can drop a single URL into DMs or interviews to show behavior without asking anyone to clone a repo.  
- **Scope guardrails:** Pens force me to keep things small; if the surface area blows up, that is a signal to graduate to a repo.
- **Visual proof:** GIFs and screenshots live beside the code so reviewers see behavior before clicking anything.

## What I Carry Into Every Pen

- Small CSS token set (spacing, typography, brand colors) so pens look related.  
- Console helpers (`console.table`, inline debug overlays) for fast inspection.  
- A “Reality” badge that states AI involvement, known bugs, and TODOs.  
- Copy blocks that admit what is missing (“Mobile audio limited,” “Keyboard nav WIP”).  
- A cleanup checklist: keyboard, focus ring, reduced motion, and loading states before I publish.

## How I Start a Pen (Even When I Don’t Know Enough)

1. **Talk like a human:** “I want a calculator that won’t crash on divide by zero,” not “build me a perfect architecture.”  
1. **Let AI propose a first file:** Folder structure + a single entry point. Nothing more.  
1. **Ship a broken version fast:** Paste, run, screenshot the error. That’s my real syllabus.  
1. **Iterate with receipts:** I send errors back to AI, adjust, and log “Reality” notes in the pen description.  
1. **Graduate or archive:** Stable pens move to GitHub repos with tests; noisy ones stay on CodePen as cautionary tales.
1. **Add observability:** Even in tiny pens I include console tables, inline status text, and sometimes a debug overlay that renders current state—cheap observability muscles.

## Anchor Pens & What They Taught Me

| Pen | Link | Focus | Reality snapshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Garbage Collection Visualizer | [Pen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzoWpL) | Mark-and-sweep animation via vanilla JS/CSS | Good for interviews. Numbers are illustrative, not engine-accurate. AI helped outline the visuals. |
| React Calculator | [Pen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ogvGZjJ) | Controlled inputs + `useState` patterns | Handles multiple decimals + divide-by-zero messaging. Keyboard support still TODO. |
| Sound Machine | [Pen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dPbVvoa) | Keyboard accessibility + audio APIs | Resetting `audio.currentTime` prevents overlaps; mobile audio quirks remain. |
| Markdown Previewer | [Pen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzXeEJ) | `marked` + sanitization | Gracefully handles malformed input. Needs tests before repo promotion. |
| Regex Analyzer | [Pen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dyEYbPO) | Regex visualization + copy-to-clipboard | Explains capture groups; AI wrote starter text, I rewrote logic. |
| Random Quote Generator v1/v2 | [Pen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/azoLpeG) / [Pen](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/PwYJWMY) | Async fetches + design iteration | Shows my jump from “works” to “pleasant.” Debounce and loading states are in. |

## Learning Pattern That Keeps Me Honest

1. **Set a hypothesis:** “Can I explain garbage collection visually?” “Can I mask card numbers accessibly?”  
1. **Instrument immediately:** `console.table`, live regions, overlays—debug without leaving the pen.  
1. **Break it on purpose:** Invalid inputs, rapid keypresses, offline mode. Note what fails and why.  
1. **Document the truth:** Each pen gets a “Reality” block with scope, AI involvement, and TODOs.  
1. **Promote selectively:** Stable pens graduate to GitHub + tests + CI (CheeseMath is the pattern).  
1. **Archive without guilt:** If it stays noisy, I leave it as a lesson, not a product.
1. **Track drift:** When a pen diverges from its original intent, I either rename it or split it. This prevents “mystery blobs” that do too much.

## Case Study: Card Obscurer (CheeseMath)

- Goal: practice credit card masking/validation with clear UX.  
- Live demo: [https://bradleymatera.github.io/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests/](https://bradleymatera.github.io/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests/).  
- Reality: regex alone was brittle; added Luhn checks, inline errors, and ARIA labels.  
- Next: axe/Lighthouse audits + unit tests before calling it “portfolio-ready.”

## Case Study: Garbage Collection Visualizer

- Goal: teach myself GC phases (mark, sweep) without hand-waving.  
- Build notes: started with AI-generated SVG circles; rewrote to a simple canvas grid to control performance. Added a “slow-mo” toggle to see the sweep phase.  
- Reality: numbers are illustrative, not tied to real engine telemetry. Memory fragmentation visuals are crude but good enough to talk through in interviews.  
- Next: log simulated heap snapshots to show fragmentation over time and link out to real engine docs for honesty.

## Case Study: Sound Machine

- Goal: practice keyboard accessibility and audio APIs together.  
- Build notes: AI scaffolded the key map; I rewrote focus management and added ARIA live regions for “playing” announcements.  
- Reality: desktop is solid; mobile Safari throttles audio without user gestures. I document that right in the pen.  
- Next: lightweight visualizer bars (no canvas) and a latency note comparing browsers.

---

## Case Study: Regex Analyzer

- Goal: turn abstract regex into readable feedback.  
- Build notes: AI drafted the table; I added copy-to-clipboard with fallback, highlighted capture groups, and error handling for malformed patterns.  
- Reality: complex lookbehinds still trip it up; I flag that in the “Reality” section.  
- Next: mini “regex cookbook” with preset patterns and pitfalls, plus a toggle to show the raw JavaScript errors.

---

## Where AI Helps and Where It Breaks Things

- **Helps:** bootstrap layouts, remind me of API signatures, draft copy, generate starter tests, propose folder trees.  
- **Hurts:** invents config options, forgets previous decisions, mixes CSS methodologies, and overfits to frameworks I am not using.  
- **Mitigation:** I pin patterns (e.g., “stick to CSS modules,” “use fetch not axios”), paste real errors, and keep scope narrow (one file at a time).

## My Monthly Retro Loop

- **AI disclosure:** If Copilot/ChatGPT wrote most of it, I label it “Needs manual review.”  
- **Backlog maintenance:** `codepen-ideas.md` tracks upcoming pens + references (MDN, WCAG).  
- **Graduation list:** Pens that earn repos, tests, and CI.  
- **Stalled list:** Pens that stay messy—kept as learning artifacts, not hidden.  
- **Metric:** Did I learn something I can reuse? If yes, I document and keep it. If no, I archive ruthlessly.

---

## How I Decide to Graduate a Pen to a Repo

- **Stability:** fewer than 2 open “Reality” bugs.  
- **Accessibility:** basic keyboard + screen reader checks pass.  
- **Testing:** at least one smoke test or story that guards core behavior.  
- **Deployment plan:** static export works on GitHub Pages/Netlify without hacks.  
- **Honesty note:** README includes AI usage and remaining gaps.

---

## Common Failure Modes (and How I Respond)

- **Performance dips:** If FPS drops in a canvas pen, I cap draw calls or switch to CSS animations.  
- **State bugs:** I log state transitions in a sidebar so I can see bad flows instantly.  
- **API shifts:** If a library updates, I lock versions in the pen description and plan a follow-up.  
- **Scope creep:** If features pile up, I fork the pen and freeze the original as “v1.”  
- **Caching ghosts:** If assets or service workers stick around, I version URLs and add a “hard refresh” note.  
- **CSS thrash:** When class names balloon, I reset to a minimal spacing/typography palette, then reapply components.

## Debugging & Observability Checklist

- [ ] Reproduce on a clean load (disable cache).  
- [ ] Capture the exact error stack and paste it into the pen description.  
- [ ] Log network requests + payloads; note CORS/caching layers.  
- [ ] Add inline status text (loading/error/success) that is visible without DevTools.  
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only flows and focus order.  
- [ ] Validate on Chrome + mobile Safari for audio/input pens.  
- [ ] Record a quick GIF of the failure for future-me.

---

## Tactics for Staying Honest

- Include a “Reality” badge in the pen header.  
- Write the failure case first (“Does not support mobile Safari yet”).  
- Link to the GitHub issue or TODO that tracks the gap.  
- Capture a GIF of the broken behavior so future me remembers why it mattered.

---

## What AI Does for Me (and What It Breaks)

- **Useful:** starter components, regex helpers, CRUD stubs, copy tweaks, quick diagrams.  
- **Risky:** inventing APIs that don’t exist, mixing patterns mid-pen, forgetting my file paths, and hallucinating service worker settings.  
- **Guardrails:** I paste real errors back, constrain scope, and rewrite any security-sensitive code by hand.

## Prompt Recipes I Actually Use

- “Give me a minimal folder structure for React in a single CodePen. Keep styles in one CSS file. No TypeScript.”  
- “Write one React component that renders X behavior. Do not include build config.”  
- “Here is the error log. Fix only what the error mentions. Do not refactor the rest.”  
- “Rewrite this copy to be honest about what is broken and what is stable.”  
- “Generate Jest tests for this function; prefer `vitest` style but avoid external mocks.”  
- “Summarize what this pen currently does in 3 bullets for a README.”

---

## Next Steps

- Convert Garbage Collection, Sound Machine, and Regex Analyzer into repos with Jest + axe checks.  
- Add a “skills index” page mapping pens to concepts (interview prep).  
- Record short GIFs (Giphy) per pen to show behavior before someone clicks.

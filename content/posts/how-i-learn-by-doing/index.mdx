## Introduction

Hands-on experimentation is the fastest way for me to absorb new concepts. Instead of reading about APIs or frameworks in the abstract, I build small CodePen projects, observe what works, break them deliberately, and document the fix. Below is a curated set of pens that helped me internalise JavaScript memory management, React state, audio handling, Markdown rendering, and canvas drawing. Each entry highlights the goal, the implementation, and the key lesson.

## Project Highlights

### JavaScript Garbage Collection Demo
- **CodePen:** [View the demo](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzoWpL)  
- **Goal:** Visualise the mark-and-sweep garbage collection algorithm used by modern JavaScript engines (described in MDN’s “Memory Management” guide).  
- **Implementation:** Users click buttons to allocate “green” blocks. When capacity is exceeded, the simulation marks unreachable nodes in red and removes them, mirroring how the engine deallocates unreachable objects.  
- **Lesson:** Understanding the mark-and-sweep cycle explains why long-lived references can cause leaks even in garbage-collected languages.

### React Calculator
- **CodePen:** [Try the calculator](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ogvGZjJ)  
- **Goal:** Practise React hooks and controlled components.  
- **Implementation:** A functional component stores operands and operators with `useState`. Guard clauses prevent invalid decimal entries, and the UI updates on every state change.  
- **Lesson:** `useState` preserves values between renders, and guarding against invalid input prevents `NaN` cascades.

### Sound Machine
- **CodePen:** [Launch the soundboard](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dPbVvoa)  
- **Goal:** Learn keyboard accessibility and HTML5 audio controls.  
- **Implementation:** Key events trigger audio playback. Resetting `audio.currentTime` before replay ensures samples do not overlap.  
- **Lesson:** Event listeners and media APIs must handle rapid user interaction; resetting the playhead keeps the experience clean and accessible.

### Markdown Previewer
- **CodePen:** [Open the previewer](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzXeEJ)  
- **Goal:** Explore integrating third-party libraries into a reactive UI.  
- **Implementation:** The app uses the `marked` library to convert Markdown into HTML in real time. Fallback logic prevents crashes when the user submits malformed text.  
- **Lesson:** Libraries accelerate development, but defensive programming (try/catch, input validation) keeps the experience resilient.

### Random Quote Generators
- **CodePens:** [Version 1](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/azoLpeG) and [Version 2](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/PwYJWMY)  
- **Goal:** Strengthen familiarity with arrays, randomisation, and async patterns.  
- **Implementation:** The first version uses a static quote list and ensures tweets respect the 280-character limit. The second iteration adds UI polish and debounced button handlers.  
- **Lesson:** Iterating on a project teaches reuse, performance tweaks, and the value of small design refinements.

### Canvas Data Visualisation
- **CodePen:** [Inspect the chart](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dyEYbPO)  
- **Goal:** Practice drawing with the `<canvas>` API and scaling numeric data.  
- **Implementation:** Users pick a range, the script generates random values, and bars are scaled to fit the canvas height.  
- **Lesson:** Canvas coordinates start at the top-left, so translating values and constraining heights is critical for accurate charts.

## Learning Patterns

1. **Set a hypothesis.** Decide what you want to observe (“How does garbage collection work?” “How do controlled inputs behave?”).  
2. **Prototype quickly.** CodePen’s live preview encourages small, incremental changes rather than large refactors.  
3. **Instrument and test.** I log outputs, try edge cases, and purposely break functionality to discover hidden bugs.  
4. **Document in place.** Each pen now includes a short summary and relevant documentation links so future revisits are faster.

## Next Steps

- Convert the most useful pens into GitHub repositories with README notes and basic tests.  
- Add automated accessibility checks (using axe and Lighthouse) to the soundboard and calculator.  
- Create a lightweight blog index that links each pen to the lesson it teaches, making it easier to reference during interviews or mentorship sessions.

  <h1 class="content-heading-1">How I Learn by Doing: My CodePen Journey</h1>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    Hey, I’m Brad. I’ve been messing around with web stuff for a couple years now, mostly because I’m a student at Full Sail University finishing my web dev degree (started Aug 2023, 3.85 GPA, done Oct 2025). I don’t really get computer science from books—I learn by doing. CodePen’s been my playground for that. I’ve built a bunch of things there, some for school, some just for fun, and every one’s taught me something real. Here’s everything I’ve done on CodePen, with legit examples of what I figured out along the way.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">JavaScript Garbage Collection Tutorial</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzoWpL" class="content-link">codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzoWpL</a></li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What It Is</strong>: A demo I made for a class to show how JavaScript cleans up memory. You click to add green blocks (memory) and trigger red garbage cleanup.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What I Learned</strong>: I didn’t get memory management at first—like, how does JavaScript know what to toss? Building this showed me the “mark-and-sweep” idea. I tested it by adding too many blocks—found a loop that didn’t stop and fixed it by resetting the count. It’s basic, but it clicked for me.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">React Calculator</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ogvGZjJ" class="content-link">codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ogvGZjJ</a></li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What It Is</strong>: A calculator I built with React for a school project. It adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides—normal stuff.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What I Learned</strong>: This was my first real React thing. I learned hooks like <code class="content-code">useState</code> by making the numbers update live. I broke it with decimals at first—kept getting NaN—so I tested and added a check to stop that. It’s not perfect, but I got how React keeps things moving.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Sound Machine</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dPbVvoa" class="content-link">codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dPbVvoa</a></li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What It Is</strong>: A soundboard I made for fun with JavaScript. Click buttons or press keys (Q, W, E, etc.) to play drum sounds.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What I Learned</strong>: I figured out event listeners here—clicks and keydowns. Sounds overlapped at first, which was annoying, so I tested it and added <code class="content-code">audio.currentTime = 0</code> to reset them. It’s simple, but I learned how to debug audio stuff by breaking it on purpose.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Markdown Previewer</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzXeEJ" class="content-link">codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzXeEJ</a></li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What It Is</strong>: A tool I built with JavaScript and marked.js to type Markdown and see HTML live, done for a class.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What I Learned</strong>: I got how libraries like marked.js work—plug it in, and it does the heavy lifting. I tested it with weird inputs—empty text crashed it—so I added a fallback to show nothing instead. It’s my first real-time thing, and I learned to watch for edge cases.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Random Quote Machine</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/azoLpeG" class="content-link">codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/azoLpeG</a></li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What It Is</strong>: A JavaScript quote generator with a button to get new quotes and tweet them, made for school.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What I Learned</strong>: I learned arrays and random picks here—just a list of quotes I pulled online. The tweet button broke with long quotes, so I tested and cut them down to fit Twitter’s limit. It’s basic, but I got how to hook up buttons to actions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Random Quote Generator</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/PwYJWMY" class="content-link">codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/PwYJWMY</a></li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What It Is</strong>: Another JavaScript quote thing I did for fun, styled nicer with a tweet option too.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What I Learned</strong>: This was me playing with CSS more—made it look decent. It froze if I clicked too fast, so I tested and added a delay to stop that. I learned I could reuse ideas from the last quote thing but make it better by breaking it first.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Data Visualization</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dyEYbPO" class="content-link">codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dyEYbPO</a></li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What It Is</strong>: A Canvas bar chart I made for a class. You pick a number range, and it shows random bars.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>What I Learned</strong>: Canvas was new—I had to figure out how to draw stuff with JavaScript. Bars went off-screen at first, so I tested big numbers and scaled them down. It’s not fancy, but I learned to test visuals, not just code.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">How I Learn</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    I don’t sit and read about this stuff—I build it, break it, and fix it. Like, I didn’t know what <code class="content-code">useState</code> was until I made the calculator crash and had to figure it out. Or how audio works until the soundboard sounded like garbage. Every CodePen’s a little mess I clean up, and that’s how I’ve gotten okay at JavaScript, React, and CSS over two years. I’m not a pro—I’ve got no job experience—but I’ve learned a ton by doing, and I’m ready to keep going with real testing at a place like Johnson Health Tech. All my CodePen stuff’s at <a href="https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera" class="content-link">codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera</a> if you want to see it.

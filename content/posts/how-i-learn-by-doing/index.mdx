I learn faster when I build something small and ship it.

This post shows the loop I use: pick a goal, build, verify, and document the lesson.

You will get exact steps and a simple template you can reuse.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- plan a tiny project you can finish
- ship it with a live link
- document what you learned in a repeatable format

> "Small demos with proof teach faster than big plans."

## What this is

**High level:** A learning loop is a short cycle of build, verify, and document.

**Low level:** You write a README, add a live link, and capture one lesson in a notes file.

**Key terms:**

- **Demo:** A small project with one clear feature.
- **Proof link:** A URL that shows the demo works.
- **Lesson:** A short note about what you learned and what to change next.

## What you need

- A GitHub repo
- A live deploy target (GitHub Pages is enough)
- A notes file in the repo

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Define the smallest goal
Goal:
Pick a single feature that you can finish in a weekend.

Actions:
- File path: `README.md`
- Add a goal line:
  ```text
  Goal: Play one sound when a user clicks a card.
  ```

Why:
A single goal keeps the scope small. It reduces unfinished work. It also makes verification simple. You cannot learn from a demo that never ships.

Verify:
- Expected: the goal is one sentence and measurable.
- This confirms the scope is small.

If it fails:
- Symptom: the goal reads like a full product.
- Fix: cut features until it fits in one sentence.

### Step 2: Build the smallest feature
Goal:
Implement the core feature only.

Actions:
- File path: `src/index.js` (or your entry file)
- Add a button or handler for the one feature.
- Example:
  ```js
  button.addEventListener("click", () => audio.play());
  ```

Why:
The smallest feature proves the idea. This keeps the demo real and testable. It also avoids spending time on polish before the feature works. You can add polish later if the core works.

Verify:
- Run the app locally.
- Click the button.
- Expected: the audio plays.
- This confirms the core feature works.

If it fails:
- Symptom: nothing happens on click.
- Fix: check the element ID and the event listener binding.

### Step 3: Add a proof link
Goal:
Make the demo public so others can verify it.

Actions:
- Deploy to GitHub Pages or another static host.
- Add the URL to `README.md`:
  ```text
  Live demo: https://yourname.github.io/your-repo/
  ```

Why:
A public link is the proof. It also forces you to finish the build step. Without a live link, the demo is just a claim. This is how you build trust.

Verify:
- Open the URL in a browser.
- Expected: the demo loads and works.
- This confirms the demo is real.

If it fails:
- Symptom: 404 or blank page.
- Fix: check the base path and rebuild.

### Step 4: Write the lesson
Goal:
Record what you learned in a short, repeatable format.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/lessons.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Lesson
  - What worked:
  - What broke:
  - What I would change next:
  ```

Why:
The lesson is the real output of the project. It keeps your learning visible. It also makes it easier to explain the project later. A short template keeps it from turning into a novel.

Verify:
- Open `docs/lessons.md` and fill the three lines.
- This confirms the learning is captured.

If it fails:
- Symptom: the file stays empty.
- Fix: write one sentence per line and move on.

## Verify it worked

- The demo runs locally.
- The demo is live.
- The lesson template is filled out.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** The demo never ships.  
  **Cause:** The goal was too big.  
  **Fix:** cut it down to one feature.

- **Symptom:** The demo works but has no proof link.  
  **Cause:** You skipped deploy.  
  **Fix:** deploy before you call it done.

- **Symptom:** The lesson is vague.  
  **Cause:** No template.  
  **Fix:** use the three line format.

## Cheat sheet

- One feature.
- One proof link.
- One lesson template.
- Repeat.

## Next steps

- Build a second demo in a different tool.
- Share one lesson with a peer.

## Final CTA

Ship the small demo. Then write the lesson while it is fresh.

description: "What a series of CodePen experiments taught me about JavaScript memory management, React state, event handling, and visualisation."

> **Context:** CodePen is where I practice front-end concepts while I finish school and internships—I haven’t shipped these as client work.  
> **AI assist:** Some pens started as ChatGPT or Copilot scaffolds; I label that in each pen description and edited this post on 2025-10-15.  
> **Status:** Learning log meant to show how I iterate, not proof of production experience.

## TL;DR

- **I learn best by shipping tiny experiments.** CodePen lets me prototype ideas, break them safely, and document the fix.  
- **Each pen targets one skill.** Garbage collection visuals, React state, audio handling, Markdown rendering, and canvas maths all earned their own sandbox.  
- **Iterate, instrument, document.** Logs, edge-case tests, and inline notes turn experiments into reusable references.  
- **Next step: productionise.** Move the most valuable pens to GitHub repos with accessibility checks and READMEs.

## Why CodePen Works

- Live previews encourage quick iterations instead of giant refactors.  
- Breaking features on purpose reveals how APIs fail, not just how they succeed.  
- Documenting lessons inside each pen makes future refreshers fast.

## Project Highlights

### JavaScript Garbage Collection Demo
- **CodePen:** [View the demo](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzoWpL)  
- **Goal:** Visualise the mark-and-sweep garbage collection algorithm used by modern JavaScript engines (described in MDN’s “Memory Management” guide).  
- **Implementation:** Users click buttons to allocate “green” blocks. When capacity is exceeded, the simulation marks unreachable nodes in red and removes them, mirroring how the engine deallocates unreachable objects.  
- **Lesson:** Understanding the mark-and-sweep cycle explains why long-lived references can cause leaks even in garbage-collected languages.

### React Calculator
- **CodePen:** [Try the calculator](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ogvGZjJ)  
- **Goal:** Practise React hooks and controlled components.  
- **Implementation:** A functional component stores operands and operators with `useState`. Guard clauses prevent invalid decimal entries, and the UI updates on every state change.  
- **Lesson:** `useState` preserves values between renders, and guarding against invalid input prevents `NaN` cascades.

### Sound Machine
- **CodePen:** [Launch the soundboard](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dPbVvoa)  
- **Goal:** Learn keyboard accessibility and HTML5 audio controls.  
- **Implementation:** Key events trigger audio playback. Resetting `audio.currentTime` before replay ensures samples do not overlap.  
- **Lesson:** Event listeners and media APIs must handle rapid user interaction; resetting the playhead keeps the experience clean and accessible.

### Markdown Previewer
- **CodePen:** [Open the previewer](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzXeEJ)  
- **Goal:** Explore integrating third-party libraries into a reactive UI.  
- **Implementation:** The app uses the `marked` library to convert Markdown into HTML in real time. Fallback logic prevents crashes when the user submits malformed text.  
- **Lesson:** Libraries accelerate development, but defensive programming (try/catch, input validation) keeps the experience resilient.

### Random Quote Generators
- **CodePens:** [Version 1](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/azoLpeG) and [Version 2](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/PwYJWMY)  
- **Goal:** Strengthen familiarity with arrays, randomisation, and async patterns.  
- **Implementation:** The first version uses a static quote list and ensures tweets respect the 280-character limit. The second iteration adds UI polish and debounced button handlers.  
- **Lesson:** Iterating on a project teaches reuse, performance tweaks, and the value of small design refinements.

### Canvas Data Visualisation
- **CodePen:** [Inspect the chart](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dyEYbPO)  
- **Goal:** Practice drawing with the `<canvas>` API and scaling numeric data.  
- **Implementation:** Users pick a range, the script generates random values, and bars are scaled to fit the canvas height.  
- **Lesson:** Canvas coordinates start at the top-left, so translating values and constraining heights is critical for accurate charts.

## Learning Patterns

1. **Set a hypothesis.** Decide what you want to observe (“How does garbage collection work?” “How do controlled inputs behave?”).  
2. **Prototype quickly.** CodePen’s live preview encourages small, incremental changes rather than large refactors.  
3. **Instrument and test.** I log outputs, try edge cases, and purposely break functionality to discover hidden bugs.  
4. **Document in place.** Each pen now includes a short summary and relevant documentation links so future revisits are faster.

## Next Steps

- Convert the most useful pens into GitHub repositories with README notes and basic tests.  
- Add automated accessibility checks (axe, Lighthouse) to the soundboard and calculator.  
- Build a blog index mapping each pen to the skill it reinforces for interview prep and mentorship.

## Key Takeaways

- **Make learning visible.** Each experiment includes notes, resource links, and logs so future-me remembers the “why.”  
- **Test edge cases deliberately.** Triggering rapid audio playback or broken Markdown surfaces hidden bugs.  
- **Promote what works.** Pens that add lasting value graduate to repos with tests, accessibility checks, and documentation.

> **Context:** CodePen is my low-stakes playground while I knock out school and internship work. None of these pens are production apps—they’re teaching myself out loud.  
> **AI assist:** Copilot/ChatGPT sometimes generated starter components or regex patterns. Each pen description and this post label where AI helped.  
> **Status:** Learning log, not a portfolio of client projects.

## Why CodePen?

- **Instant feedback:** No local setup; I can prototype an idea in minutes.  
- **Safe failure:** Breaking a pen doesn’t take down Netlify or a Render backend.  
- **Documentation:** Every pen description now includes a “Reality” block (what works, what doesn’t, what AI wrote).

## Anchor pens & lessons

| Pen | Link | Focus | Reality snapshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Garbage Collection Visualizer | [https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzoWpL](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzoWpL) | Mark-and-sweep animation using vanilla JS + CSS transitions | Helps me explain GC interviews. Numbers are illustrative, not actual engine data. |
| React Calculator | [https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ogvGZjJ](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ogvGZjJ) | Controlled inputs + `useState` patterns | Tests edge cases (multiple decimals, divide by zero). Keyboard support still TODO. |
| Sound Machine | [https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dPbVvoa](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dPbVvoa) | Keyboard accessibility + audio APIs | Resetting `audio.currentTime` prevents overlapping sounds; mobile support is limited. |
| Markdown Previewer | [https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzXeEJ](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/ZYzXeEJ) | 3rd-party libs (`marked`) + sanitization | Handles malformed input gracefully; still need unit tests before promoting to GitHub. |
| Regex Analyzer | [https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dyEYbPO](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/details/dyEYbPO) | Regex visualisation + copy-to-clipboard flow | Highlights matches, explains capture groups. Heavy use of AI-generated starter text. |
| Random Quote Generator v1/v2 | [https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/azoLpeG](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/azoLpeG) / [https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/PwYJWMY](https://codepen.io/student-account-bradley-matera/pen/PwYJWMY) | Async fetches, debouncing, design iteration | Shows how I go from “functional” to “nicer UX” in public. |

## Learning pattern

1. **Set a hypothesis:** e.g., “Can I explain garbage collection visually?” or “Can I mask card numbers accessibly?”  
2. **Clone a pen or start blank:** Add a `Reality` block at the top describing scope + AI involvement.  
3. **Instrument early:** `console.table` logs, accessible live regions, or overlays help me debug without leaving the pen.  
4. **Break it on purpose:** Try invalid inputs, rapid keyboard events, or network failures. Log what broke and why.  
5. **Document:** Notes go in the pen description + my `codepen-journal.md` file (repo: `learning-journal`).  
6. **Promote (if deserving):** Once a pen stays stable, I move it into a GitHub repo with tests + accessibility checks (CheeseMath started this way).

## Example: Card Obscurer (CheeseMath)

- Built to practice credit card masking/validation.  
- Live demo sits at [https://bradleymatera.github.io/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests/](https://bradleymatera.github.io/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests/); pen version shows the original concept.  
- Lessons learned: regex alone isn’t enough; I added Luhn checks and clear error messaging.  
- Next steps: integrate axe/Lighthouse audits before calling it “done.”

## How I keep myself honest

- **AI disclosure:** Pen descriptions state what Copilot/ChatGPT generated. If a section is mostly AI, I mark it “Needs manual review.”  
- **Backlog:** `codepen-ideas.md` lists upcoming experiments and links to research (MDN, WCAG, etc.).  
- **Retros:** At the end of each month I log “Pens that graduated to GitHub” vs “Pens that stalled.” Helps me avoid hoarding half-baked demos.

## Next steps

- Convert top-performing pens (Garbage Collection, Sound Machine, Regex Analyzer) into GitHub repos with tests + CI.  
- Add automated axe/Lighthouse checks via GitHub Actions for the pens I embed into the portfolio.  
- Build a “skills index” page mapping each pen to the concepts it reinforces—useful for interview prep and peer mentoring.

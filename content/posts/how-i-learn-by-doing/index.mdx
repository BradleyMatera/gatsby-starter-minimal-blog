I learn faster by building than by watching.

This post explains the small demo method I use. It keeps scope tight and progress visible.

You will get the steps, the checklist, and the common traps.

## The promise

You will learn:

- how to pick a demo
- how to keep scope small
- how to document what you learned

> "If the demo is tiny, the lesson is clear."

## The method

1. Pick a single goal.
2. Build the smallest version.
3. Write a short note.

### Example note template

```text
Goal:
What worked:
What failed:
What I learned:
```

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Choose a tool you want to learn.
2. Build a tiny demo in one day.
3. Write a one page note.

### Common mistakes

- Picking a big project.
- Skipping the notes.
- Waiting for perfect understanding.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] One goal
- [ ] One demo
- [ ] One note

## Next steps

- Build one demo this week.

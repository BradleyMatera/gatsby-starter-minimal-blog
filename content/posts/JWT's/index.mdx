## JSON Web Tokens (JWTs): Solving a CTF Challenge Step-by-Step

In this blog post, I walk you through the intricate process of solving a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge where JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) played a key role. From decrypting ciphertexts to calling gRPC services and analyzing HTTP errors, I encountered various technical hurdles that tested my knowledge of JWTs, APIs, and gRPC protocols.

Let's dive in step-by-step.

---

### üéØ **The Starting Point**

The challenge provided a file, `token.md`, which contained an initial **PAGE_TOKEN**. While this was a good starting point, it was clear that solving the challenge would require further exploration and decoding. 

---

### üîç **Decrypting the First Ciphertext**

The first major milestone involved working with the **`secretbox.md`** file. This file contained:

- **Encrypted Data (Ciphertext)**  
- **A Key**  
- **A Nonce**  

Using Base64 decoding and the **Libsodium library** (a popular cryptography tool), I decrypted the first ciphertext and successfully retrieved a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.

### üöÄ **What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?**

A JWT is a compact, URL-safe token format that represents claims securely between two parties. A JWT consists of:

1. **Header**: Contains metadata like the token type (JWT) and the signing algorithm (e.g., HS256).
2. **Payload**: Contains the claims, such as `sub` (subject) or custom claims (e.g., `token`).
3. **Signature**: Verifies the token's authenticity using a secret key.

Here's the structure of the JWT I obtained:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbiI6IkpXVF9UT0tFTiJ9.ghpSD18-j76IdRH3xqaKk1-PrnyzOq3E5kiqUGLXzBI
  `}
  language="plaintext"
/>

Deconstructing this JWT revealed the payload:

```json
{
  "token": "JWT_TOKEN"
}
```

üîë **Using the JWT to Get a CONNECT_UNARY_TOKEN**

Once I decrypted the JWT, I knew it was crucial for authorization. I used it as a Bearer Token for a call to the GetToken endpoint. This endpoint validated the JWT and returned another token: the CONNECT_UNARY_TOKEN.

Example Request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN" \
-d '{}' \
https://prod-backend-ctf.us-east-1.prod-services.fetchrewards.com/token.v1.TokenService/GetToken
```

üîì **Decrypting the Second Ciphertext**

The next part of the challenge led me back to secretbox.md. A second ciphertext was present. This time, I had to:
1. Strip specific bytes from the ciphertext.
2. Decrypt the remaining data using the same nonce and key.

Following this process, I obtained another token: NA_CL_SECRET_TOKEN.

ü§ù **Connecting to the StreamToken Endpoint**

With the following tokens now in hand:
1. PAGE_TOKEN
2. JWT_TOKEN
3. CONNECT_UNARY_TOKEN
4. NA_CL_SECRET_TOKEN

I attempted to access the StreamToken endpoint using tools like grpcurl and a Python gRPC client.

Here's an example of the final Python client I built:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
import grpc
import token_service_pb2
import token_service_pb2_grpc

# Use the CONNECT_UNARY_TOKEN or NA_CL_SECRET_TOKEN
token = "CONNECT_UNARY_TOKEN"

channel = grpc.secure_channel(
    'prod-backend-ctf.us-east-1.prod-services.fetchrewards.com:443',
    grpc.ssl_channel_credentials()
)

stub = token_service_pb2_grpc.TokenServiceStub(channel)
metadata = [('authorization', f'Bearer {token}')]

request = token_service_pb2.StreamTokenRequest(message="ping")

try:
    for response in stub.StreamToken(request, metadata=metadata):
        print(response.message)
except grpc.RpcError as e:
    print("Error:", e.code(), e.details())
  `}
  language="python"
/>

Despite using all the right tokens and tools, I encountered persistent HTTP 464 errors and malformed header responses from the server. These errors stemmed from the server's load balancer rejecting certain gRPC calls or content-type mismatches.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Obstacles Faced**

Here's a summary of the issues I encountered:
- HTTP 464: Indicates a server-side issue, likely from an AWS ELB rejecting the gRPC headers or data.
- Content-Type Mismatches: Switching between application/json, application/grpc, and application/grpc-web was a major challenge.
- Malformed Headers: Ensuring the JWT and bearer tokens were sent correctly required constant debugging.

üí° **What I Learned About JWTs**
1. JWTs Are Powerful: They enable secure and stateless authorization.
2. Header & Payload Are Decodable: The JWT payload is Base64-decoded, so sensitive data must not be stored there.
3. Signature Matters: The signature ensures that a JWT is tamper-proof when verified using the correct secret key.

üî® **Tools I Used**
- grpcurl: A CLI tool for interacting with gRPC endpoints.
- Python gRPC: A client for handling complex gRPC calls with credentials.
- curl: Testing HTTP/2 headers and content types.
- Libsodium: For decryption of ciphertexts.

üèÅ **Conclusion**

While I successfully decrypted JWTs, obtained tokens, and connected to endpoints, the challenge highlighted the complexity of handling gRPC communication, load balancer nuances, and token-based authentication. Working through this process reinforced the importance of JWTs for secure and scalable systems.

If you're tackling a similar challenge, remember:
1. Always validate and decode JWTs carefully.
2. Test multiple content types (grpc, grpc-web, json).
3. Be persistent‚Äîdebugging is half the battle!

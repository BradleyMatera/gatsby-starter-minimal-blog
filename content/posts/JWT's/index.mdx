> **Context:** Discord-hosted winter CTF focused on JWT chaining + gRPC transport. Everything happened on my laptop—no production systems touched.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT walked me through Libsodium quirks, grpcurl flags, and token-claim gotchas whenever I stalled. I stored each prompt/response in the repo for transparency.  
> **Status:** Documenting the lab so classmates (and future-me) can reproduce the ladder without assuming I’ve run auth incidents in the wild.

## Reality snapshot

- The lab shipped starter artifacts (`PAGE_TOKEN`, `secretbox.md`, proto files). I supplied the glue code, TLS setup, and troubleshooting.  
- Every token exchange was scripted; nothing was “click next.” I automated decrypt → verify → request to avoid mis-ordering steps under time pressure.  
- The “win” was extracting a final streaming token, not supporting real users. Treat this as a study note, not evidence of production mastery.

## What I set up

### Files & scaffolding

- `ctf-tools/ctf_jwt_walkthrough.py` decrypts the Libsodium payload, verifies claims with PyJWT (audience checks disabled for the lab), and logs timestamps for each hand-off.  
- `ctf-tools/grpc_client.py` wraps the generated Python stubs so I can swap `AUTH_TOKEN` via flags (`--bootstrap`, `--unary`, `--stream`).  
- `notes/terminal-log.md` captures every command, header, and response code so reviewers see exactly what I typed.  
- TLS certs from the challenge live in `certs/lab/`. I pinned them in grpcurl with `--cacert` and re-used them in the Python client.

### Toolchain

| Tool | Why I needed it |
| --- | --- |
| Libsodium / PyNaCl | Replayed the XSalsa20-Poly1305 decrypt (`secretbox_open`) using the provided key + nonce. |
| PyJWT | Verified signatures, printed claims, and disabled `verify_aud` when the lab intentionally left audiences blank. |
| grpcurl | Fast pokes at unary vs streaming methods; helpful for spotting header mistakes. |
| Python gRPC client | Produced more detailed stack traces than grpcurl when HTTP 464s popped up. |
| Wireshark + `openssl s_client` | Confirmed the TLS handshake + ALPN negotiation; crucial when proxies silently closed streams. |

## The ladder, step by step

1. **Bootstrap decode** – `jwt.io` + PyJWT let me inspect the `PAGE_TOKEN`. Seeing the `kid` claim point at `secretbox.md` confirmed the symmetric key route.  
2. **Ciphertext decrypt** – Base64 decoded the key/nonce/ciphertext, fed them into Libsodium, and got `JWT_TOKEN`. I scripted retries because mistyping Base64 once meant starting over.  
3. **Token trading** – Each call to `token.v1.TokenService/GetToken` issued a more scoped token (`CONNECT_UNARY_TOKEN`, `NA_CL_SECRET_TOKEN`, etc.). I exported whichever token was current to `AUTH_TOKEN` so subsequent commands read it automatically.  
4. **Streaming flag** – `StreamToken` refused to cooperate until I normalised every header to lowercase (`authorization`, `te`) and forced `content-type: application/grpc`. Once those matched, the Render-style proxy let the stream through and I grabbed the flag.

## Troubleshooting log

| Symptom | Root cause | How I fixed it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP 464, zero server logs | Sent JSON or uppercase headers through the proxy | Forced lowercase metadata + `application/grpc` every time. |
| Token verification failed | Audience check still enabled | Passed `options={"verify_aud": False}` to `jwt.decode`. |
| gRPC metadata missing | Used `Authorization` instead of `authorization` | Lowercased the header; ALB stripped the uppercase version. |
| TLS handshake reset midstream | Forgot to pin the provided cert | Added `--cacert certs/lab/rootCA.pem` (and equivalent in Python) before retries. |
| Manual token swaps caused mistakes | Copy/paste fatigue | Wrote `scripts/set-token.sh <token_file>` to export the current value. |

## Evidence that I actually did the work

- **Scripts & notes:** `ctf-tools/`, `notes/terminal-log.md`, and `notes/ai-prompts.md` live in the repo so reviewers can replay every command.  
- **Packet capture:** `captures/streamtoken-success.pcapng` shows the working HTTP/2 exchange (ClientHello → SETTINGS → HEADERS/DATA).  
- **Gist snippet:** [https://gist.github.com/BradleyMatera/ctf-jwt-notes](https://gist.github.com/BradleyMatera/ctf-jwt-notes) (redacted secrets) demonstrates the decrypt + verify loop.  
- **Prompt log:** Lists each ChatGPT conversation that influenced the code so I don’t present AI-generated output as my own insight.

## What’s still on the todo list

- Convert the markdown logs into a repeatable workshop (maybe a `README.md` with copy/paste commands).  
- Add pytest coverage for the helper scripts and publish them as a `ctf-tools` package when they’re less fragile.  
- Explore gRPC-Web + Envoy because most browser clients I touch won’t support native gRPC.  
- Build a tiny dashboard showing which token you’re currently holding; right now it’s just environment variables and terminal echoes.

  <h1 class="content-heading-1">Understanding JWTs: JSON Web Tokens in Web Security</h1>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a compact, self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. This post explores what JWTs are, how they work, and their role in modern web security and authentication systems.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">What Are JWTs?</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    A JWT is a standard for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims. It consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature, which are Base64Url encoded and separated by dots (.). These tokens are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">How JWTs Work</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Header</strong>: Contains metadata about the token, such as the type of token and the signing algorithm used.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Payload</strong>: Holds the claims or data, like user ID or roles, which are the statements about an entity.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Signature</strong>: Ensures the token hasn't been altered by signing the encoded header and payload with a secret key.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Use Cases</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    JWTs are widely used in scenarios requiring secure data exchange. Common use cases include Single Sign-On (SSO), API authentication, and session management. They allow servers to be stateless, as all necessary information is contained within the token itself.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Advantages and Challenges</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Advantages</strong>: JWTs are compact, self-contained, and can be easily passed through URLs, headers, or cookies. They enable stateless authentication, reducing server load.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Challenges</strong>: If not implemented correctly, JWTs can be vulnerable to attacks like token theft or improper validation. They also can't be revoked easily once issued unless additional mechanisms are in place.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Implementing JWTs</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    I've experimented with JWTs in personal projects, implementing them for API authentication using libraries like <code class="content-code">jsonwebtoken</code> in Node.js. Ensuring secure storage of the secret key and setting appropriate expiration times were key lessons learned during testing.

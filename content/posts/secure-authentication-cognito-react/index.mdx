This is a lab guide for a small React auth demo.

It does not claim production ownership or enterprise setup.

You will set up a user pool, wire it to React, and verify the flow.

If you are new to Cognito, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, Cognito manages user sign up and sign in.

Low level, you create a user pool and connect it in your app config.

Key terms:

- **User pool**: Cognito’s user directory.
- **App client**: a client id that your app uses to connect.
- **Hosted UI**: Cognito’s optional login UI.

## What you need

- An AWS account.
- A React app.
- Basic AWS console access.

Docs used:

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/

## Start to finish

1) Create a user pool.

Why: The user pool is the core auth store.

2) Create an app client.

Why: Your app needs a client id to connect.

3) Copy the pool and client IDs into your app config.

Why: Your app needs to know where to authenticate.

Example config:

```js
export const authConfig = {
  region: "us-east-1",
  userPoolId: "us-east-1_XXXX",
  clientId: "abcd1234",
};
```

4) Add a basic sign in screen.

Why: You need a UI to test the flow.

5) Test sign up and sign in.

Why: This verifies the pool works.

## Verify it worked

- You can create a user.
- You can sign in.
- Tokens appear in your app logs.

If sign in fails, check the app client and region.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Invalid client error.
  **Cause**: Wrong client id.
  **Fix**: Copy the correct id from AWS.

- **Symptom**: Region mismatch.
  **Cause**: Using the wrong region.
  **Fix**: Set the correct region in config.

- **Symptom**: Callback errors.
  **Cause**: Missing callback URL.
  **Fix**: Add the correct URL in Cognito.

## Cheat sheet

- Create user pool.
- Create app client.
- Configure app.
- Test sign up and sign in.

## Next steps

- Add MFA in a lab.
- Add error states in UI.

This is lab work, not a production system.

I used Cognito to learn the auth flow and document the steps. That is the scope.

You will get a short setup, a checklist, and common mistakes.

## The promise

You will learn:

- the basic Cognito flow
- how I document each step
- where I stopped

> "Auth is only real when the steps are repeatable."

## The basic flow

1. Create a user pool.
2. Configure an app client.
3. Wire it into the React UI.

### Example config shape

```js
export const authConfig = {
  region: "us-east-1",
  userPoolId: "us-east-1_XXXX",
  clientId: "abcd1234",
};
```

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Set up a user pool.
2. Test sign up and sign in.
3. Write a short notes file.

### Common mistakes

- Mixing region and pool ID.
- Forgetting callback URLs.
- Skipping logout testing.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Sign up works
- [ ] Sign in works
- [ ] Notes written

## Next steps

description: "A candid inventory of the tools I use—what I’m comfortable with, what I’m learning, and what’s purely experimental."
theme: "Front-End & Full-Stack"
---

> **Context:** Full Sail grad + AWS intern, still pre-first SWE job. This stack reflects the tech I touch in portfolio projects (Car-Match, Triangle Shader Lab, CheeseMath, AWS labs).  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped group the tools and reminded me to tag comfort levels.  
> **Status:** Living document. I update it whenever my habits change.

## Languages & comfort levels

| Language | Primary use | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TypeScript** | React SPAs, Node APIs | Comfortable for prototypes. Generics/utility types still require docs. |
| **JavaScript (ES2023)** | CodePens, Gatsby/Vite builds | Daily driver. Async patterns + DOM APIs feel natural. |
| **Python** | AWS labs, automation scripts, FastAPI demos | Learning. Comfortable with scripting; still new to larger apps. |
| **HTML/CSS** | Semantic layouts, Tailwind tokens | Comfortable. Accessibility/language semantics baked into every project. |
| **C#/Java** | Coursework + interview prep | Exploring. No production experience. |
| **PHP** | Legacy coursework | Rarely used now. |

## Frameworks & libraries

- **React / Next.js / Gatsby:** Main UI stack (this site, SPA résumés, CheeseMath). Hooks + context + Suspense for state management.  
- **Node.js + Express:** Lightweight REST APIs (BasicServerSetup, Car-Match backend).  
- **FastAPI:** Local experiments for Convo-AI. Still prototyping.  
- **Tailwind CSS:** Default styling approach (consistent tokens, responsive utilities).  
- **PixiJS / Three.js:** Used in Triangle Shader Lab + other visual experiments. AI helps me reason through graphics math.  
- **Testing:** Jest/Supertest (backend), Testing Library (frontend), Playwright (auth labs).

## Cloud/DevOps toolkit

| Area | Tools | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hosting & deploys | Netlify, GitHub Pages, Render, AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, EKS labs) | Netlify/Pages host most sites. Render handles Car-Match backend (free tier). AWS used for labs + serverless experiments. |
| Data | DynamoDB, MongoDB Atlas, PostgreSQL | DynamoDB for serverless labs, Mongo for Car-Match, Postgres for BasicServerSetup prototypes. |
| Containers | Docker Compose, ECR, EKS labs | Compose for daily usage, EKS for workshops. No production clusters yet. |
| IaC | Terraform, SAM/Serverless Framework | Terraform for EKS labs, SAM for serverless APIs. CDK still experimental. |
| Observability | CloudWatch, Netlify analytics, simple `/healthz` endpoints | Need to add Sentry/OTel eventually. |

## Productivity stack

- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD for all repos (lint, test, build, deploy).  
- **Notion + Obsidian:** Project tracking, honesty logs, study notes.  
- **VS Code + Copilot Chat:** Editor + AI pair programming.  
- **Postman/Bruno:** API testing collections.  
- **Slack + Loom:** Async updates to mentors/recruiters.  
- **Apple Health/Whoop:** Sleep/stress data that feeds planning decisions.

## Focus areas

1. **Accessibility-first UI:** Semantic HTML, skip links, screen reader testing, color contrast.  
2. **API design + auth:** Building JWT/Cognito flows, documenting endpoints, writing runbooks.  
3. **CI/CD automation:** GitHub Actions templates for Netlify/Render/AWS deploys.  
4. **Cost-aware architectures:** Serverless + free-tier hosting keep demos affordable.  
5. **Honesty + documentation:** `honesty.md`, README “Reality” sections, and runbooks for every project.

## Currently exploring

- **AWS Bedrock / Q Business:** Responsible AI workflows, prompt logging, access controls.  
- **Policy-as-code:** OPA + AWS Config for guardrails (still lab-only).  
- **Edge rendering:** Next.js + Cloudflare Workers experiments for faster global delivery.  
- **Zig + WebGPU:** Low-level performance practice (Triangle Shader Lab, OBJ Parser).

## Next steps

- Deepen AWS Developer Associate prep (tie it to CheeseMath backend).  
- Add tracing/log aggregation to personal projects (maybe OpenTelemetry + Grafana Cloud).  
- Harden Car-Match backend (Mongo Atlas, Render, Ops docs) so it remains honest even when folks poke at it.  
- Publish my GitHub Actions templates + Notion trackers so others can reuse them.

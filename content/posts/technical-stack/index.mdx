description: "A guided tour of the languages, frameworks, cloud services, and workflows I rely on—and why they fit the problems I solve."

> **Context:** Snapshot of the tools I actually touch as an early-career developer (Full Sail grad, AWS intern, still pre-first dev job).  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped organise this list; I filled in the comfort levels on 2025-10-15.  
> **Status:** Everything below notes whether I’m comfortable, still learning, or just exploring so nobody mistakes breadth for mastery.

## TL;DR

- **Stable stack beats shiny stack.** I prioritise tools with strong ecosystems, predictable upgrade paths, and automation hooks.[^typescript]
- **Serverless + containers cover the workload spectrum.** AWS Lambda, ECS, and managed front-end hosts let me scale from prototype to production fast.
- **Observability and IaC stay non-negotiable.** CloudWatch, OpenTelemetry, and Terraform prevent blind spots and configuration drift.
- **Curiosity stays scoped.** I experiment with AI services, policy-as-code, and edge rendering without disrupting the proven baseline.[^bedrock]

## Stack Goals

- Balance delivery speed with maintainability across front end, backend, and infrastructure.
- Choose tooling that supports accessibility, automation, and collaborative workflows.
- Keep costs predictable through right-sized compute, serverless defaults, and observability.
- Allocate time for targeted experiments that may evolve into next-year staples.

## Core Languages

| Language | Primary Use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | Front-end SPAs, Node.js APIs | Comfortable for prototypes; still lean on docs for advanced generics.[^typescript] |
| JavaScript (ES2023) | Rapid prototypes, browser-first demos | Daily driver for CodePen + Gatsby work; AI helps scaffold tricky pieces. |
| Python | Automation, scripts, data tooling | Used in AWS internship labs + FastAPI demos; practicing TDD habits. |
| C# / Java | Strongly typed backends and interview prep | Coursework + LeetCode practice only; not production-ready yet. |
| HTML & CSS | Semantic layouts, Tailwind/Tokens | Confident with semantics/accessibility; still learning advanced CSS art direction. |
| PHP (legacy) | Maintenance work on inherited stacks | Light exposure through school assignments; rarely used now.

The common thread is readability plus strong tooling. TypeScript, in particular, gives me confidence to refactor aggressively because compiler errors highlight blind spots before runtime.

## Frameworks & Libraries

- **React & Next.js.** My default for interactive UIs. Hooks, Suspense, and React Testing Library make state management and testing predictable.  
- **Node.js + Express.** A thin layer for REST APIs and webhooks. Express middleware keeps auth, logging, and validation modular.  
- **Vue & Angular (exploratory).** I periodically prototype features in these ecosystems to broaden my perspective on component architectures.  
- **Tailwind CSS + CSS Modules.** Utility classes accelerate design systems while keeping outputs accessible.  
- **jQuery (maintenance).** Legacy codebases still use it; understanding its patterns helps me plan incremental rewrites.

## Cloud & DevOps Stack

| Capability | Services / Tools | Why it is in the stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hosting & Compute | AWS (Lambda, ECS, EC2), Vercel, Netlify | Lambda demos + Netlify/GitHub Pages host my portfolios; ECS/EC2 used in labs but not yet in prod. |
| Storage & Data | DynamoDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, S3 | DynamoDB + S3 power serverless prototypes; relational/document stores still in learning rotation. |
| Networking & Delivery | API Gateway, CloudFront, Nginx | API Gateway handles auth/rate limiting in labs; CloudFront/Nginx knowledge comes from coursework + experiments. |
| Observability | CloudWatch, OpenTelemetry, Sentry | CloudWatch dashboards/logs are real; OTel/Sentry currently limited to sandbox repos. |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform, AWS CDK, Serverless Framework | Terraform + Serverless manage personal projects; CDK usage limited to AWS workshops for now. |

I aim for infrastructure that can scale horizontally with minimal manual intervention. Monitoring and IaC are non-negotiable on new projects.

## Productivity & Collaboration

- **Git & GitHub.** Feature-branch workflows, pull requests with checklists, and required status checks keep changes reviewable.  
- **GitHub Actions.** Automates linting, testing, container builds, and deployments (see my CI/CD-focused post for deeper coverage).  
- **Postman & Bruno.** Repeatable API collections for regression testing.  
- **VS Code + Copilot Chat.** Tailored profiles per project, EditorConfig integration, and remote SSH sessions for cloud instances.  
- **Linux (WSL & EC2).** A consistent terminal environment streamlines shell scripts and deployment tooling.

## Specialties & Focus Areas

1. **API design and authentication (learning).** Building REST endpoints with predictable status codes + auth flows (JWTs, Cognito) in personal projects.  
2. **CI/CD automation (comfortable).** GitHub Actions pipelines deploy this portfolio + lab apps; still exploring CodeBuild/cross-account IAM.  
3. **Distributed troubleshooting (learning).** Practice correlating logs/metrics in CloudWatch; tracing/OpenTelemetry still in the sandbox.  
4. **Low-cost architectures (comfortable for prototypes).** Serverless defaults + budget alerts keep hobby projects inexpensive.  
5. **Accessibility-first interfaces (comfortable).** Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, and design tokens for contrast compliance.

## Currently Exploring

- **AWS Bedrock & SageMaker JumpStart** for responsible AI integrations.[^bedrock]  
- **Infrastructure policy as code** (Open Policy Agent, AWS Config) to enforce guardrails from day one.  
- **Edge rendering** via Next.js and Cloudflare Workers to reduce latency for global users.

## Results

- **Faster feature delivery:** On personal projects, TypeScript + React + GitHub Actions pipelines push changes to Netlify/GitHub Pages in under an hour (small teams = just me).  
- **Predictable infrastructure:** Terraform + Serverless keep dev/prod parity for my demos; CDK is still in lab mode.  
- **Lower operational cost:** Serverless-first choices (Lambda, DynamoDB, Vercel/Netlify free tiers) keep experimentation affordable.

## Lessons Learned

- **Tooling discipline beats trend chasing.** Investing in well-supported frameworks yields fewer rewrites.
- **Observability pays back immediately.** CloudWatch dashboards and tracing expose bottlenecks before users do.
- **Accessibility scales as a habit.** Keeping semantic HTML and design tokens central prevents expensive retrofits.

## Next Steps

- Pilot Bedrock-backed features with clear guardrails before broader rollout.
- Expand policy-as-code coverage to include cost anomaly detection and tagging enforcement.
- Experiment with edge rendering for data-light pages to improve global Lighthouse scores.

## Key Takeaways

- **Stable, observable stacks help teams ship faster with fewer surprises.**
- **Serverless, containers, and IaC cover most workload shapes without heavy ops overhead.**
- **Intentional experimentation keeps the stack modern without risking production stability.**

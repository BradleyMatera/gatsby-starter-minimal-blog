Your stack should be a list you can prove, not a wish list.

This post shows how I document what I use, what I am learning, and what is next.

You will create a stack file and verify each item with a repo or demo.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- write a stack inventory you can defend
- link each tool to proof
- separate comfort from learning

> "If there is no proof link, it is not on the stack list."

## What this is

**High level:** A stack inventory is a short list of tools you actually use.

**Low level:** You list tools and link to a repo or demo that proves usage.

**Key terms:**

- **Comfort:** Tools you can ship with today.
- **Learning:** Tools you are still practicing.
- **Proof link:** A repo or demo that shows you used the tool.

## What you need

- A notes file
- Links to your repos and demos

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create a stack file
Goal:
Write down your current stack categories.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/stack.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Stack
  Comfort:
  - React
  - TypeScript
  Learning:
  - WebGPU
  - AWS
  ```

Why:
A clear list prevents overclaiming. It also makes updates easy. Splitting comfort and learning keeps your story honest. This format scales as your skills change.

Verify:
- Open the file and confirm the categories exist.
- This confirms the structure is ready.

If it fails:
- Symptom: list is vague.  
  **Fix:** use specific tool names.

### Step 2: Add proof links
Goal:
Link each tool to a real example.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/stack.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Proof:
  - React: https://github.com/BradleyMatera/AnimalSounds
  - WebGPU: https://github.com/BradleyMatera/TriangleDemo
  ```

Why:
Proof links turn claims into facts. They also help readers verify quickly. This keeps the stack list grounded in work you can show. It is the simplest honesty check.

Verify:
- Click each link.
- Expected: repo or demo opens.
- This confirms the proof is real.

If it fails:
- Symptom: link 404.  
  **Fix:** update the URL or remove the tool.

### Step 3: Add a short update note
Goal:
Record one change to the stack.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/stack.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Update: Added WebGPU after shipping TriangleDemo.
  ```

Why:
A short update note shows progression. It also prevents the list from becoming stale. This makes your stack more believable. One line is enough.

Verify:
- Confirm the update is a single sentence.
- This confirms the note is concise.

If it fails:
- Symptom: the note reads like a blog post.  
  **Fix:** cut it to one sentence.

## Verify it worked

- Stack list is split into comfort and learning.
- Every tool has a proof link.
- Update note exists.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Stack reads like a buzzword list.  
  **Cause:** No proof.  
  **Fix:** add links or remove items.

- **Symptom:** No difference between comfort and learning.  
  **Cause:** Everything is listed as equal.  
  **Fix:** split into two lists.

- **Symptom:** Stack never updates.  
  **Cause:** No update note.  
  **Fix:** add one update line per quarter.

## Cheat sheet

- Split comfort and learning.
- Add proof links.
- Add one update note.

## Next steps

- Replace one learning item with comfort once you ship a demo.
- Add a link to your stack file from your README.

If you cannot prove a tool, leave it off the list.

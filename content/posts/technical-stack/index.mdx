This is a living list. It changes as my projects change.

I only list tools I have used in a demo or lab. Anything else is marked as planned.

You will get the structure I use and a checklist for keeping it honest.

## The promise

You will learn:

- how I track comfort levels
- how I tie tools to demos
- how I avoid over-claims

> "If I cannot point to a demo, I do not list the tool."

## The structure

### Example format

```text
Tool: where I used it
Status: comfortable, learning, planned
Proof: repo or demo link
```

## CTA: Open the demos

- https://bradleymatera.dev/projects/

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. List your tools.
2. Mark comfort level.
3. Add one proof link per tool.

### Common mistakes

- Listing tools you touched once.
- Hiding gaps.
- Mixing planned with real.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Comfort level set
- [ ] Proof link added
- [ ] Planned items labeled

## Next steps

- Update your list this month.
- Remove one tool you did not use.
- Add one demo link.

This is a strict inventory, not a wishlist.

I only list tools I have used in a demo or lab.

You will get the structure, the checks, and a template to keep it honest.

If you want to publish your stack, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a list of tools tied to evidence.

Low level, it is a format that links each tool to a repo or demo.

Key terms:

- **Comfort level**: how confident you are using a tool.
- **Proof link**: a repo or demo URL that backs the tool.
- **Planned**: a tool you plan to try, not one you already used.

## What you need

- A list of tools you actually used.
- One proof link per tool.
- A short note for planned tools.

## Start to finish

1) List each tool you used.

Why: This is the base inventory.

2) Add a comfort level.

Why: It shows honesty and gaps.

3) Attach a proof link.

Why: The proof link prevents over-claiming.

### Example format

```text
Tool: React
Status: comfortable
Proof: https://bradleymatera.dev
```

## Verify it worked

- Each tool has one proof link.
- Planned tools are labeled clearly.
- There are no vague claims.

If you cannot prove a tool, remove it.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Stack looks impressive but vague.
  **Cause**: No proof links.
  **Fix**: Add the link or remove the tool.

- **Symptom**: Claims feel inflated.
  **Cause**: Mixing planned and real tools.
  **Fix**: Separate planned items.

- **Symptom**: List grows too large.
  **Cause**: No pruning.
  **Fix**: Remove unused tools monthly.

## Cheat sheet

- One tool, one proof link.
- Comfort level for each tool.
- Planned tools labeled.

## Next steps

- Add proof links to your stack today.
- Remove one tool you cannot prove.

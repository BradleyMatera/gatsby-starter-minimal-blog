This is a prototype lab, not a shipped app.

I built it to learn the core flow and document the steps.

You will get setup, build, verify, and cleanup.

If you are new to React Native, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a mobile UI prototype using React Native.

Low level, it is a project setup, one screen, and a basic navigation flow.

Key terms:

- **Metro**: the dev server for React Native.
- **Expo**: a toolchain that simplifies React Native dev.
- **Prototype**: a small build to test one idea.

## What you need

- Node.js 18 or later.
- Expo CLI installed.
- A phone or emulator.

Docs used:

- https://docs.expo.dev/
- https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started

## Start to finish

1) Create a new Expo app.

Why: Expo handles setup fast.

```bash
npx create-expo-app my-prototype
cd my-prototype
npm start
```

2) Build one screen.

Why: You need a working UI to test.

3) Add one navigation route.

Why: Navigation is the first real test.

4) Run on a device.

Why: Mobile behavior is different from web.

## Verify it worked

- The app runs on the device.
- The screen renders without errors.
- Navigation works in both directions.

If it does not run, restart Metro and clear cache.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: App fails to load.
  **Cause**: Metro cache issues.
  **Fix**: Restart with `expo start -c`.

- **Symptom**: Navigation errors.
  **Cause**: Missing navigation setup.
  **Fix**: Follow the React Navigation docs.

- **Symptom**: UI looks wrong on device.
  **Cause**: Using web-only styles.
  **Fix**: Use React Native style rules.

## Cheat sheet

- Use Expo for setup.
- Build one screen first.
- Test on a real device.

## Next steps

- Add a second screen.
- Add a simple form.
- Keep the prototype small.

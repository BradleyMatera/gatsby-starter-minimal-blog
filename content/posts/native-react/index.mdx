  <h1 class="content-heading-1">Building Mobile Apps with React Native</h1>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    React Native has become a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. In this post, I share my experience developing a mobile CRUD application for anime data using React Native, along with the lessons learned during the process.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Why React Native?</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    As a web developer familiar with React, transitioning to React Native was a natural choice for mobile development. It allows for code reuse across iOS and Android platforms, significantly reducing development time while maintaining a native look and feel.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Project: Anime CRUD App</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    I built a mobile application that enables users to create, read, update, and delete anime data. This project integrated a backend API built with Node.js and MongoDB, hosted on Heroku, with the frontend deployed on Vercel.

    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Demo</strong>: <a href="https://cruddemo-one.vercel.app/" class="content-link">cruddemo-one.vercel.app</a></li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Technologies</strong>: React Native, Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku, Vercel</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Key Features</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item">User-friendly interface for managing anime entries.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">RESTful API integration for persistent data storage.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">Responsive design ensuring usability on various device sizes.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    One challenge was handling state management in React Native. I initially struggled with asynchronous data fetching, which led to UI delays. By implementing proper state handling with hooks like <code class="content-code">useEffect</code> and thorough testing, I ensured smooth data updates. Another hurdle was navigation; using React Navigation, I tested different navigation patterns to find the most intuitive user flow.

  <h2 class="content-heading-2">What I Learned</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item">Adapting React concepts to mobile development with React Native.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">Managing platform-specific quirks, like styling differences between iOS and Android.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">Importance of testing user interactions on actual devices or emulators for accurate feedback.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    Building with React Native opened up new possibilities for me in mobile app development. It reinforced my belief in learning by doingâ€”each bug fixed and feature added taught me something practical. If you're interested in mobile development, I highly recommend giving React Native a try.

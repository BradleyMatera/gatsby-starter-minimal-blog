Mobile prototypes only matter if they run on a device.

This post shows a small React Native setup you can verify.

You will create a new app, render one screen, and confirm it runs.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- create a React Native project
- render a simple screen
- verify it runs on a simulator

> "If it does not run on a device, it is not done."

## What this is

**High level:** React Native lets you build mobile apps with React.

**Low level:** You use the CLI to scaffold a project and edit `App.tsx`.

**Key terms:**

- **Simulator:** A local device emulator.
- **Bundle:** The JavaScript code packaged for the app.

## What you need

- Node 18+
- React Native CLI
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create the project
Goal:
Scaffold a new React Native app.

Actions:
- Command:
  ```bash
  npx react-native@latest init NativeLab
  cd NativeLab
  ```

Why:
The CLI sets up the native project structure. It also creates iOS and Android folders for you. This is the fastest way to get a runnable app. It avoids manual config mistakes.

Verify:
- Expected: `ios/` and `android/` folders exist.
- This confirms the scaffold worked.

If it fails:
- Symptom: CLI error about dependencies.  
  **Fix:** follow the CLI output and install required tools.

### Step 2: Edit the main screen
Goal:
Render one clear view so you can verify changes.

Actions:
- File path: `App.tsx`
- Replace the body with:
  ```tsx
  import React from "react";
  import { SafeAreaView, Text } from "react-native";

  export default function App() {
    return (
      <SafeAreaView style={{ padding: 24 }}>
        <Text>NativeLab is running.</Text>
      </SafeAreaView>
    );
  }
  ```

Why:
A simple screen is enough to verify the app runs. It avoids extra components. It also makes hot reload obvious. This is your baseline for future changes.

Verify:
- Run the app and confirm the text appears.
- This confirms the edit is live.

If it fails:
- Symptom: red screen error.  
  **Fix:** check imports and file name.

### Step 3: Run the app
Goal:
Launch the app in a simulator.

Actions:
- Command for iOS:
  ```bash
  npx react-native run-ios
  ```
- Command for Android:
  ```bash
  npx react-native run-android
  ```

Why:
Running the app is the proof. It confirms your environment is correct. It also confirms your code compiles. Without this, the project is not real.

Verify:
- Expected: app opens and shows "NativeLab is running."
- This confirms the build and run steps work.

If it fails:
- Symptom: emulator not found.  
  **Fix:** start the simulator first.

## Verify it worked

- The app launches.
- The text appears.
- No red screen errors show.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Metro server not running.  
  **Cause:** no bundler process.  
  **Fix:** run `npx react-native start`.

- **Symptom:** iOS build fails.  
  **Cause:** missing Xcode tools.  
  **Fix:** install Xcode and accept the license.

- **Symptom:** Android build fails.  
  **Cause:** emulator not running.  
  **Fix:** start Android Studio emulator.

## Cheat sheet

- Scaffold with `react-native init`.
- Edit `App.tsx`.
- Run on a simulator.

## Next steps

- Add one button.
- Add a second screen with navigation.

Get one screen running before you build anything bigger.

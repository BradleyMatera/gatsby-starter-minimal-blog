# 🎨 Building a React Native Anime CRUD App

Welcome to the journey of creating my React Native CRUD application! This project brought together multiple APIs and a dynamic mobile app interface to deliver a seamless experience for anime enthusiasts. Here's a complete breakdown of how I built the project from the ground up.

---

## 🛠️ **Project Overview**

This app serves two main purposes:
1. Fetching random anime data from the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/).
2. Allowing users to manage an anime character database (CRUD operations) via my custom RESTful API hosted on Heroku.

Key features include:
- Fetching random anime with detailed synopsis and an eye-catching background.
- A dynamic list of characters pulled from my API.
- Full CRUD functionality: Add, update, and delete characters directly from the app.

---

## 🌟 **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **API Integration**: Jikan API and my custom API
- **Deployment**: Hosted using Heroku and Expo Go for mobile preview.

---

## 🎨 **User Interface**

### Homepage Layout:
- A **random anime** title and synopsis, complete with a dynamically updated background image.
- A **scrollable list** of characters fetched from the API.
- **Forms** for adding and updating characters.
- **Delete buttons** for easy removal of unwanted entries.

### Highlights:
The app seamlessly combines data from two sources, presenting users with a visually appealing and highly interactive interface.

## 📁 **Project Structure**

Here's how the app is organized:

```plaintext

├── 📄 App.js                  # Main app logic
├── 📁 componants/             # UI components
│   ├── 📄 Heading.js          # Displays titles
│   ├── 📄 ListContainer.js    # Handles character listing
├── 📁 assets/                 # Image assets

├── 📄 app.json                # Expo configuration
└── 📄 README.md               # Project documentation
```

## 🌐 **Backend API Routes**

I built a custom REST API to handle character management:
- Fetch all characters: GET /animeCharacters
- Fetch a specific character: GET /animeCharacters/:id
- Add a character: POST /animeCharacters
- Update a character: PATCH /animeCharacters/:id
- Delete a character: DELETE /animeCharacters/:id

Each route is designed for smooth integration with the React Native app.

## 🔧 **React Native Features**

The app leverages React Native's strengths for building a dynamic mobile experience:

### Fetching Random Anime Data:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://api.jikan.moe/v4/random/anime')
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      if (data?.data) {
        setAnimeData(data.data);
        setBackgroundImage(data.data.images.jpg.large_image_url);
      }
    })
    .catch((err) => console.error(err));
}, []);
```

### CRUD Functionality:

Here's an example of the addCharacter function for creating a new character:

```javascript
const addCharacter = () => {
  fetch('https://bradleycruddemo-1b86f27b4c16.herokuapp.com/api/v1/animeCharacters', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(newCharacter),
  })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      setCharacters([...characters, data]);
      setNewCharacter({ name: '', anime: '', powerLevel: '' });
    })
    .catch((err) => console.error(err));
};
```

### Dynamic UI:
- Forms: TextInput fields for adding and updating characters.
- ListContainer Component: Displays characters with delete functionality.

## 🚀 **Deployment**

### Backend:
- Deployed using Heroku, with the MongoDB database hosted on Atlas.

### Frontend:
- Used Expo for smooth development and testing.
- Published the app via Expo's QR code system for instant mobile preview.

## 💡 **Lessons Learned**
1. API Integration: Handling multiple APIs in a single app requires careful planning and state management.
2. Error Handling: Adding robust error messages improved both debugging and user experience.
3. Mobile Styling: React Native demands attention to responsive layouts, especially with dynamic data.

## 🔮 **Future Improvements**
1. Authentication: Add secure user authentication to the API.
2. Pagination: Enable pagination for large character lists.
3. Offline Support: Use local storage to handle data without internet connectivity.
4. Enhanced UI: Improve the overall design with animations and custom components.

## 📬 **Conclusion**

This project has been a thrilling journey, blending anime fandom with mobile app development. By combining React Native and Express, I've created a powerful tool for anime enthusiasts to explore and manage their favorite characters.

### Next Steps for Gatsby:
- Use Gatsby's Image API to optimize the banner image.
- Add MDX for interactive code samples.
- Implement GraphQL to fetch blog metadata dynamically.

This was a prototype. It is not a shipped product.

I wrote this post to document the learnings while they were fresh.

You will get the key lessons, a checklist, and a small snippet.

## The promise

You will learn:

- what worked in the prototype
- what broke
- what I would do next

> "A prototype is useful only if the notes are clear."

## What I built

- A basic navigation flow
- A small data view
- A few UI components

### Example component structure

```text
/components
/screens
/navigation
```

## CTA: Open the repo

- https://github.com/BradleyMatera

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Build one screen.
2. Add one list or form.
3. Write one note about what broke.

### Common mistakes

- Skipping device testing.
- Ignoring performance warnings.
- Overbuilding before the flow works.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] One flow works
- [ ] Notes written
- [ ] Limits listed

## Next steps

- Add a real device test.
- Keep scope small.
- Update the notes.

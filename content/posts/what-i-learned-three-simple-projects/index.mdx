Small projects teach faster than long plans.

This post shows three demos and the exact lesson format I use.

You will build a short project list, add proof links, and write one lesson each.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- list three small demos with proof links
- write one lesson per demo
- keep the list current with an update date

> "One lesson with proof beats a page of claims."

## What this is

**High level:** This is a small project review format that keeps learning visible.

**Low level:** You write a list of demos and add a one line lesson under each.

**Key terms:**

- **Proof link:** A URL that shows the demo works.
- **Lesson:** A short statement of what you learned.

## What you need

- Three demos
- A notes file
- Working URLs

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create the list file
Goal:
Create a single file that lists the three projects.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/three-projects.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Three projects
  - AnimalSounds: https://bradleymatera.github.io/AnimalSounds/
  - CheeseMath: https://bradleymatera.github.io/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests/
  - EthicsFrontEndDemo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/EthicsFrontEndDemo/
  ```

Why:
A list keeps the content scannable. It also ensures the proof links are visible. This prevents vague summaries. It makes updates quick.

Verify:
- Click each link.
- Expected: each demo loads.
- This confirms the proof works.

If it fails:
- Symptom: 404.  
  **Fix:** update the link or remove the project.

### Step 2: Add one lesson per project
Goal:
Write one short lesson tied to each demo.

Actions:
- Under each project line, add:
  ```text
  Lesson: Base paths matter for GitHub Pages.
  ```

Why:
A single lesson keeps the post short and honest. It also makes the demo more useful. One line is easier to verify than a paragraph. It keeps the format consistent.

Verify:
- Each project has exactly one lesson line.
- This confirms consistency.

If it fails:
- Symptom: lessons are long and vague.  
  **Fix:** cut to one sentence with a concrete fix.

### Step 3: Add an update date
Goal:
Show when the list was last refreshed.

Actions:
- Add to the top of the file:
  ```text
  Updated: 2025-10-04
  ```

Why:
An update date signals recency. It keeps the list honest. It also makes it easy to see when the list is stale. One line is enough.

Verify:
- The date appears at the top.
- This confirms the update is visible.

If it fails:
- Symptom: date missing.  
  **Fix:** add it and move on.

## Verify it worked

- Proof links load.
- Each project has one lesson.
- Update date is present.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Project list gets bloated.  
  **Cause:** no limit.  
  **Fix:** keep it to three projects.

- **Symptom:** Lessons are generic.  
  **Cause:** no specific outcome.  
  **Fix:** tie the lesson to a visible behavior.

- **Symptom:** Links break.  
  **Cause:** demos removed.  
  **Fix:** update or remove the link.

## Cheat sheet

- Three projects.
- Three proof links.
- Three lessons.

## Next steps

- Rotate older projects out every quarter.
- Add a screenshot per demo.

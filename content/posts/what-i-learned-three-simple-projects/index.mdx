Small projects teach faster than big plans.

This post covers three demos and the concrete lessons they gave me.

You will get the lesson format, a checklist, and links to each demo.

## The promise

You will learn:

- how I choose tiny projects
- what each one taught me
- how I document the lessons

> "A small demo with clear notes beats a big demo with no proof."

## The three projects

### 1) AnimalSounds

- Next.js App Router + NextUI + Tailwind
- Offline-ready public/audio assets
- localStorage favorites and listening stats

Demo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/AnimalSounds/

### 2) CheeseMath

- Small test-focused math demo
- Simple unit tests

Demo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests/

### 3) EthicsFrontEndDemo

- Front-end demo for security education
- Simple interactive examples

Small projects teach faster than big plans.

This post shows three demos and the exact lessons they gave me.

You will get the format I use, the steps I repeat, and links to each demo.

If you want a clean way to learn without fluff, this is it.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- pick three small project ideas that finish fast
- build and ship each demo
- write short lessons that are easy to verify

> "A small demo with proof beats a big demo with vague claims."

## What this is

**High level:** A small project is a focused demo with a single goal, a short build time, and a public link.

**Low level:** You ship a feature, verify it in the browser, and write a short lesson with proof links.

**Key terms:**

- **Demo:** A small public project with one clear capability.
- **Proof link:** A link to a repo or live page that shows the claim is real.
- **Lesson:** A short statement that says what worked and what to fix next.

## What you need

- A public GitHub repo for each demo
- A live URL for each demo
- A note template with three lines

Here are the three demos I use as examples:

- AnimalSounds: https://bradleymatera.github.io/AnimalSounds/
- CheeseMath: https://bradleymatera.github.io/CheeseMath-Jest-Tests/
- EthicsFrontEndDemo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/EthicsFrontEndDemo/

## Start to finish

1. **Pick the smallest possible goal.**
   Examples: play a sound, render a triangle, show a secure pattern.

2. **Define the one success check.**
   If it does not pass that check, it is not done.

3. **Build the demo.**
   Keep the scope tight. No extra features.

4. **Publish a live link.**
   The demo is not real until it is accessible.

5. **Write the lesson.**
   Use the three line template below.

   ```text
   Project:
   One thing I learned:
   One thing I would change next:
   ```

6. **Add proof links.**
   Put the repo and live URL in the post.

## Verify it worked

- The live demo loads without errors.
- The repo README explains how to run it locally.
- The lesson matches what the demo actually does.

If any of those fail, fix the demo or delete the claim.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Projects never finish.  
  **Cause:** The goal was too big.  
  **Fix:** Cut the goal until it can ship in one weekend.

- **Symptom:** The demo is live but the README is empty.  
  **Cause:** You skipped documentation.  
  **Fix:** Add a short setup section and a proof link.

- **Symptom:** The lesson sounds like marketing.  
  **Cause:** The lesson is not tied to a real check.  
  **Fix:** Use the template and keep it factual.

## Cheat sheet

- One goal per demo.
- One success check.
- One live link.
- One lesson template.
- Proof links everywhere.

## Next steps

- Add a small "Lessons" section to each repo README.
- Share one lesson with a peer and ask for feedback.
- Build one more demo with a different tool.

## Final CTA

Pick one small idea and ship it in two days. Then write the lesson while it is fresh.

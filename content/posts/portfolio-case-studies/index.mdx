description: "How I organised dozens of CodePen demos and GitHub repos into narrative case studies that highlight outcomes instead of isolated experiments."

> **Context:** I rebuilt my portfolio after realising scattered CodePen/GitHub links confused recruiters; this outlines the student-level system I now use.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped name the sections and edit checklists; I filled them with real inventory data on 2025-10-15.  
> **Status:** Advice from someone still job-hunting—treat the “results” as analytics from my site, not universal laws.

## TL;DR

- **Case studies outperform link dumps.** Recruiters respond when projects open with context, constraints, and outcomes instead of raw embeds.[^nng-portfolios]
- **Themes turn experiments into stories.** Grouping CodePen demos and GitHub repos under shared goals shows iteration from prototype to production.
- **Scannable layouts matter.** Consistent visuals, TL;DR panels, and selective embeds keep reviewers moving through the narrative.
- **Feedback loops guide edits.** Analytics and mentor reviews surface where to add metrics or split deep dives from summaries.

## Portfolio Goals

- Replace scattered CodePen and GitHub links with story-driven case studies.
- Highlight outcomes, roles, and iteration paths for every project grouping.
- Make it effortless for recruiters to grasp value within the first screen of each case study.
- Build a repeatable template so new work slots in without recreating structure.

## Process Highlights

### Catalog the full inventory

I logged every artifact in a spreadsheet to expose overlap and gaps:

| Column | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Project | Triangle Shader Lab |
| Asset Type | Static site, GitHub repo |
| Primary Skill | WebGPU fundamentals, shader education |
| Outcome | Translated the hello triangle sample into an annotated teaching tool |
| Links | Live demo, repository, walkthrough notes |

Tagging by skill and outcome revealed natural clusters—Triangle Shader Lab, sound machine, and garbage collection demos all fit a “learning through interactive experiments” thread.

### Bundle work into narrative buckets

- **Learning by Experimentation:** CodePen explorations covering memory management, UI patterns, and browser audio APIs.
- **Production Case Studies:** GitHub projects deployed for real users, including the Interactive Pokédex and BasicServerSetup.
- **Infrastructure & Automation:** Docker orchestration labs, GitHub Actions pipelines, and AWS infrastructure templates.

Each bucket earned its own landing section with a short overview, concrete outcomes, and links to deeper dives.

### Outline every case study the same way

Every story follows a structured checklist so reviewers always know what to expect:

- **Context:** Who benefits and what pain point are we solving?
- **Constraints:** Deadlines, resourcing, compliance, or technical limits.
- **Approach:** Architecture choices, tooling rationale, and testing strategy.
- **Outcomes:** Metrics, qualitative feedback, or lessons learned.
- **Artifacts:** Live demos, repositories, documentation, and supporting posts.

#### Example: “Learning Through Play” story

- **Context:** Micro-projects turned hard concepts into interactive lessons faster than theory alone.
- **Artifacts:** Garbage collection visualiser, React calculator, sound machine.
- **Outcome:** Drove a blog article and sped up hiring conversations because engineers could see the learning path.
- **Next steps:** Extend the series with WebAssembly-led experiments.

### Design for scanning speed

- Apply the same layout, type scale, and call-to-action placement across every case study.
- Label ownership ("Solo build", "Team project") so responsibilities are obvious at a glance.
- Showcase one looping GIF or hero image per study, then link to CodePen or GitHub for the deep dive.
- Add TL;DR summaries above the fold and keep key terms on the left edge for F-pattern readers.

### Measure and iterate continuously

- Privacy-friendly analytics surface click-through rates and reading time per case study.
- When long technical sections caused drop-offs, I moved exhaustive details into expandable "deep dive" tabs.
- Mentor feedback pushed me to quantify success (e.g., “deploys dropped from ~5 minutes to ~2 after automation”) rather than leave statements qualitative.

## Reusable Template

```markdown
## Project Overview
- **Role:** Solo developer
- **Timeframe:** Jan–Mar 2025
- **Problem:** <one-sentence goal>
- **Stack:** React, Node.js, AWS Lambda

## What I Delivered
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## Results
- Metric 1
- Lesson learned
```

Publishing and iterating on this template keeps future updates lightweight—every new project starts within the same scaffold.

## Results

- **Recruiter engagement increased.** Click tracking shows deeper navigation through themed sections instead of bailing after the first project.
- **Narratives land faster.** TL;DR panels and consistent headings help reviewers grasp value without hunting for context.
- **Iteration stays documented.** Structured outlines capture why a prototype evolved, so conversations begin with outcomes rather than code walkthroughs.

## Lessons Learned

- **Context leads the story.** Without framing, even polished demos read like random experiments.[^nng-portfolios]
- **Consistency beats novelty.** Repeating layouts felt boring at first, but scannability wins interviews.
- **Metrics matter.** Quantifying results is the difference between “interesting experiment” and “demonstrated impact.”

## Next Steps

- Expand narrative buckets with upcoming WebAssembly and WebGPU experiments.
- Automate analytics dashboards so engagement trends surface without manual exports.
- Pair each case study with a short video walkthrough for audiences who prefer richer media.

## Key Takeaways

- **Group experiments by shared outcomes so reviewers follow the story.**
- **Lead every case study with context, constraints, and measurable impact.**
- **Keep layouts familiar so readers focus on results, not navigation.**

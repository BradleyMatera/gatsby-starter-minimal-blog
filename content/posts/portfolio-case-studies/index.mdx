Case studies only work when they match the code.

This post is a full template and process for writing honest case studies.

You will get the exact sections, checks, and mistakes to avoid.

If you write portfolio case studies, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a structure for explaining a project clearly.

Low level, it is a set of sections and proof links tied to the repo.

Key terms:

- **Case study**: a short report of a project and its results.
- **Proof link**: a repo or demo URL that backs a claim.
- **Limitations**: a list of what the project does not do.

## What you need

- A repo and demo.
- A short project summary.
- A list of limits.

## Start to finish

1) Write the one sentence problem.

Why: It frames the project fast.

2) Write the one sentence solution.

Why: It explains what you built.

3) Add proof links.

Why: You need evidence.

4) Add limits.

Why: Limits prevent over-claiming.

### Example case study block

```md
Problem: one sentence
Solution: one sentence
Proof: repo and demo
Limits: one sentence
```

## Verify it worked

- Claims match the repo.
- Proof links work.
- Limits are visible.

If a claim is not in the code, remove it.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Long paragraphs with no proof.
  **Cause**: No structure.
  **Fix**: Use the template.

- **Symptom**: Tech stack mismatch.
  **Cause**: Copying old text.
  **Fix**: Update from the repo.

- **Symptom**: Missing limits.
  **Cause**: Skipping the hard parts.
  **Fix**: Add a limits section.

## Cheat sheet

- One sentence problem.
- One sentence solution.
- Proof links.
- Limits listed.

## Next steps

- Update one case study today.
- Remove one unverified claim.
- Add one proof link.

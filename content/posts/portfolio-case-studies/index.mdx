A case study is only as good as its proof links.

This post shows the small structure I use and the checks that keep it honest.

You will get the template, a checklist, and common mistakes.

## The promise

You will learn:

- a simple case study format
- how I link proof
- how I keep claims accurate

> "If the repo cannot prove it, the post should not claim it."

## The template

### Sections I keep

- Problem
- Solution
- Proof links
- Limits

### Example block

```md
Problem: one sentence
Solution: one sentence
Proof: repo or demo link
Limits: one sentence
```

## CTA: Open the portfolio

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick one project.
2. Write the four lines.
3. Add proof links.
4. Add limits.

### Common mistakes

- Long paragraphs with no proof.
- Listing tools not in the repo.
- Hiding limitations.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Proof links added
- [ ] Limits stated
- [ ] Tools match repo

## Next steps

- Update one case study today.
- Remove one unverified claim.

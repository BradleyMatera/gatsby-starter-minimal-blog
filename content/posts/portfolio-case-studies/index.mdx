description: "How I turned scattered demos into honest case studies—and the system I use to keep them updated."
theme: "Front-End & Full-Stack"

> **Context:** My portfolio used to be a pile of CodePen links and GitHub repos. Recruiters were confused, so I rebuilt everything around case studies and honesty logs.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped brainstorm section names/checklists; the content comes from actual analytics + recruiter feedback dated 2025-10-15.  
> **Status:** Still job-hunting. This is the system I actively maintain, not a retrospective on a finished product.

## Reality snapshot

- Portfolio surface = Gatsby/Netlify site + GitHub Pages template + PDF résumé.  
- Content lives in MDX case studies (`content/pages/projects/*.mdx`) so I can diff claims.  
- Analytics + recruiter feedback drive updates. If a case study stops performing, it gets rewritten or archived.  
- Honesty docs (`honesty.md`, `honestplan.md`) log every change with dates + rationale.

## Inventory first

```
| Project               | Asset Type                 | Primary Skill             | Outcome                                               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Car-Match             | GitHub repo + live demo    | React + Express practice  | Documented GitHub Pages + Render backend demo         |
| Triangle Shader Lab   | Static site + repo         | WebGPU study              | Adapted Hello Triangle/Textured Cube with explanations|
| CheeseMath            | GitHub repo + Pages demo   | Testing + Next.js         | Calculator UI + Jest practice                         |
| CodePen experiments   | CodePen embeds             | UI/UX + JS fundamentals   | Recreated in blog posts + templates                   |
```

- This spreadsheet (Notion) highlights overlap and gaps. Everything I want to highlight must have context, constraints, and proof.

## Narrative buckets I use

1. **Learning by Experimentation:** CodePens + smaller demos (Garbage Collection, Sound Machine).  
2. **Front-End/Product Work:** Interactive Pokédex, CheeseMath, SPA résumés.  
3. **Full-Stack/API:** Car-Match, React + AWS CRUD, ProjectHub.  
4. **Infrastructure/Automation:** Docker Multilang, GitHub Actions, AWS internship capstone.

Each bucket links to detailed case studies and blog posts so recruiters can scan or deep-dive.

## Case study template

```markdown
## Reality snapshot
- Sentence about scope, hosting, limitations.

## Context & constraints
- Problem, users, deadlines, tooling.

## What I built
- Architecture diagram or bullet list.
- Screenshots / gifs / proof links.

## Observability & honesty
- Health checks, analytics, TODOs, known gaps.

## Evidence
- Repo link, live demo, prompt log, runbooks.
```

- Every case study also starts with a callout: “Demo runs on free Render; expect 5-minute cold starts.” No surprises.

## Maintenance loop

1. **Measure:** Netlify analytics (time on page, exits), recruiter feedback, personal retros.  
2. **Decide:** If a case study underperforms or becomes misleading, demote it, rewrite it, or archive it.  
3. **Update:** Edit MDX + honesty docs. Note the date + reason.  
4. **Verify:** Run `bun run lint`, `npm run build`, and manual smoke tests.  
5. **Communicate:** Post the update on LinkedIn + in the honesty changelog so hiring teams see transparency.

## Results (qualitative but real)

- Recruiters now comment on specific projects (“Saw your Car-Match honesty block…”) instead of saying “nice site.”  
- I spend less time explaining what’s real because the case studies already do it.  
- I can onboard mentors quickly: “Read `/projects/caris-ai/`, then we’ll pair.”

## Next steps

- Automate analytics exports (Netlify → Google Sheets) so I can spot stale content faster.  
- Produce short Loom walkthroughs for each case study to help visual learners.  
- Ship a template repo others can fork (MDX + honesty log scaffold).

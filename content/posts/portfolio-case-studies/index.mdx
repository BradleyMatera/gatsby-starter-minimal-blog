A case study is a proof document, not a sales page.

This post gives you a short template that stays honest and scannable.

You will write one case study that links to real proof.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- write a short case study with proof links
- avoid inflated claims
- keep it readable for recruiters

> "If the proof link is missing, the claim goes away."

## What this is

**High level:** A case study explains the problem, solution, and result with proof.

**Low level:** You write a short MDX file with fixed sections and links.

**Key terms:**

- **Proof link:** A repo or demo URL.
- **Outcome:** What the project achieved, stated plainly.

## What you need

- A project repo
- A live demo URL
- A place to write the case study

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create the case study file
Goal:
Create a single file with fixed sections.

Actions:
- File path: `content/case-studies/project-name.mdx`
- Add:
  ```text
  # Project name

  ## Problem
  ## Solution
  ## What I built
  ## Outcomes and proof
  ```

Why:
Fixed sections keep the structure clear. It makes the writing faster. It also makes scanning easier. This prevents the case study from drifting into vague storytelling.

Verify:
- Open the file and confirm the headings exist.
- This confirms the structure is set.

If it fails:
- Symptom: file missing.  
  **Fix:** create the folder and file.

### Step 2: Add proof links
Goal:
Attach real proof to outcomes.

Actions:
- Under "Outcomes and proof" add:
  ```text
  - Repo: https://github.com/yourname/project
  - Demo: https://yourname.github.io/project
  ```

Why:
Proof links are the heart of the case study. They make the claims verifiable. This avoids inflated statements. It also saves reviewers time.

Verify:
- Click each link.
- Expected: the repo and demo load.
- This confirms the proof is real.

If it fails:
- Symptom: 404.  
  **Fix:** update the URL or remove the link.

### Step 3: Add one concrete outcome
Goal:
State one result that is visible in the demo or repo.

Actions:
- Example outcome:
  ```text
  - Search filters the list in real time.
  ```

Why:
Outcomes should be observable, not vague. One concrete outcome is enough. This keeps the case study honest. It also makes it easier to verify.

Verify:
- Open the demo and check the outcome.
- This confirms the statement is true.

If it fails:
- Symptom: the outcome is not visible.  
  **Fix:** remove the outcome or update the demo.

## Verify it worked

- The case study has all four sections.
- Proof links work.
- Outcomes are visible in the demo.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Case study reads like a resume bullet.  
  **Cause:** No problem or solution section.  
  **Fix:** use the template headings.

- **Symptom:** Outcomes are vague.  
  **Cause:** No proof links.  
  **Fix:** add a demo link and describe what you can see.

- **Symptom:** Claims do not match the repo.  
  **Cause:** outdated writing.  
  **Fix:** update the case study after each change.

## Cheat sheet

- Use fixed sections.
- Add proof links.
- Keep outcomes visible.

## Next steps

- Add one screenshot per case study.
- Keep a changelog for updates.

Write the shortest case study that still has proof. That is the goal.

Job hunting is rough. That is the honest starting point.

This post is a full breakdown of what helped, what failed, and what I changed.

You will get steps, checks, and a checklist you can copy.

If you are in the middle of the search, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a reality check with concrete habits.

Low level, it is a weekly routine plus a proof link system.

Key terms:

- **Proof link**: a repo or demo that backs a skill claim.
- **Signal**: a response, referral, or interview request.
- **Noise**: applications that go nowhere.

## What you need

- A simple tracker.
- A short list of strong projects.
- One sentence per project that matches the repo.

## Start to finish

1) Write a short skills list.

Why: You need clarity before applying.

2) Attach proof links to each skill.

Why: Proof is your credibility.

3) Apply to a small, focused list.

Why: Focus beats volume.

4) Do a weekly review.

Why: You need to cut noise.

### Example weekly note

```text
What I sent:
What replied:
What I will change:
```

## Verify it worked

- You can open your tracker and see the next action.
- Each skill has a proof link.
- You removed at least one weak target.

If you cannot verify proof links, fix them before applying again.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Many applications, no interviews.
  **Cause**: Weak proof links.
  **Fix**: Strengthen one demo and resubmit.

- **Symptom**: Burnout.
  **Cause**: No weekly cutoff.
  **Fix**: Set a limit and stop.

- **Symptom**: Vague resume bullets.
  **Cause**: No link to code.
  **Fix**: Add a repo or demo URL.

## Cheat sheet

- Small list of roles.
- One proof link per claim.
- Weekly review.
- Cut noise.

## Next steps

- Update one project summary today.
- Remove one claim you cannot prove.
- Send one focused application.

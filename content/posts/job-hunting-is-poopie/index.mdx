Job hunting can mess with your head.

This post is a reset. It turns the chaos into a short, repeatable loop.

You will set boundaries, track progress, and avoid burnout.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- limit daily job search time
- track applications without spiraling
- keep one honest note about what is working

> "A shorter, focused search beats a ten hour panic day."

## What this is

**High level:** This is a job search routine that protects energy and focuses on consistency.

**Low level:** You set a time box, log applications, and write one weekly lesson.

**Key terms:**

- **Time box:** A fixed block of time for a task.
- **Recovery day:** A day with no applications to avoid burnout.

## What you need

- A calendar
- A tracker file
- A notes file

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Set a daily time box
Goal:
Limit job search time to a fixed window.

Actions:
- Set a calendar event for a 90 minute block.
- Write it down in `job-search/notes.md`:
  ```text
  Daily time box: 90 minutes
  ```

Why:
Time boxes prevent burnout. They also force you to focus on the most important actions. Consistency beats intensity. This keeps job hunting from swallowing the whole day.

Verify:
- Expected: a calendar event exists for the week.
- This confirms the time box is real.

If it fails:
- Symptom: you keep extending the time box.
- Fix: stop after the alarm and pick up tomorrow.

### Step 2: Track applications
Goal:
Log each application once and move on.

Actions:
- File path: `job-search/tracker.csv`
- Add headers:
  ```text
  company,role,date_applied,status,link,notes
  ```
- Add one row per application.

Why:
A tracker is a memory system. It stops you from reapplying to the same role. It also shows patterns over time. You need data to adjust your approach.

Verify:
- Expected: at least one row is filled.
- This confirms tracking is active.

If it fails:
- Symptom: the tracker stays empty.
- Fix: add just one row right after each application.

### Step 3: Add a weekly reset note
Goal:
Write one honest note about what is working.

Actions:
- File path: `job-search/weekly-reset.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Week of:
  - What worked:
  - What did not:
  - One change next week:
  ```

Why:
This makes the process less personal and more measurable. It helps you change strategy without spiraling. One small change per week is enough. The note also becomes your proof of progress.

Verify:
- Expected: the template is filled once per week.
- This confirms the reset loop is active.

If it fails:
- Symptom: no weekly notes.
- Fix: set a recurring reminder and keep it to three lines.

## Verify it worked

- You kept the time box.
- Applications are logged.
- Weekly notes exist.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** You apply for hours and feel worse.  
  **Cause:** No time box.  
  **Fix:** set one and stop when it ends.

- **Symptom:** You forget where you applied.  
  **Cause:** No tracker.  
  **Fix:** log every application the same day.

- **Symptom:** You do the same thing every week.  
  **Cause:** No review note.  
  **Fix:** write one change each week.

## Cheat sheet

- Time box daily.
- Track every application.
- Reset weekly.

## Next steps

- Reduce low quality applications.
- Focus on better fit roles.

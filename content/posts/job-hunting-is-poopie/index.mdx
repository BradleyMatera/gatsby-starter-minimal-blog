Job hunting is rough. That is the truth.

This post is not a success story. It is a list of what helped and what did not.

You will get a short checklist and a clear next step.

## The promise

You will learn:

- which actions moved the needle
- which actions wasted time
- how I kept my notes honest

> "Effort matters, but proof matters more."

## What helped

- Shipping public demos with proof links.
- Writing short notes after each fix.
- Keeping scope small.

### Example note format

```text
What I shipped:
What broke:
What I fixed:
```

## CTA: Open the demos

## What did not help

- Mass applying without a clear target.
- Polishing resumes without updating projects.
- Waiting for motivation.

### Common mistakes

- Listing tools you did not use.
- Hiding limitations.
- Overloading the portfolio.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] One proof link per claim
- [ ] Notes updated
- [ ] One small demo shipped

## Next steps

- Update one project proof link today.
- Remove one claim you cannot prove.
- Share one demo with a person you trust.

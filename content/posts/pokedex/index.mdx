This is a static demo built to practice data loading and search.

There is no backend. The data is loaded at build time.

You will build the list, add search, and verify the result.

If you want a full static demo guide, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a static site that lists Pokemon and supports search.

Low level, it uses a build-time fetch and client-side filtering.

Key terms:

- **Static site**: pages built ahead of time.
- **Build-time fetch**: data loaded when you build, not at runtime.
- **Client-side filter**: filtering in the browser.

## What you need

- Node.js 18 or later.
- A Next.js project.
- Access to the PokeAPI.

Docs used:

- https://nextjs.org/docs
- https://pokeapi.co/

## Start to finish

1) Create a Next.js app.

Why: You need a clean app skeleton.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest pokedex
cd pokedex
```

2) Fetch data at build time.

Why: The list is static.

```js
const res = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151");
const data = await res.json();
```

3) Render the list.

Why: You need a visible grid of items.

4) Add client-side search.

Why: Search happens in the browser.

5) Add a detail page.

Why: Users need a single item view.

## Verify it worked

- The list shows 151 items.
- Search filters results.
- A detail page renders.

If the list is empty, check the fetch call and build logs.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: API fetch fails.
  **Cause**: Network errors or rate limits.
  **Fix**: Retry or cache data.

- **Symptom**: Search is slow.
  **Cause**: Filtering on every keystroke without debounce.
  **Fix**: Add a small debounce.

- **Symptom**: Detail page 404.
  **Cause**: Missing dynamic route.
  **Fix**: Create the correct route file.

## Cheat sheet

- Build-time fetch for the list.
- Client-side filter for search.
- Detail page for one item.

## Next steps

- Add type filters.
- Add loading skeletons.
- Document the data source in README.

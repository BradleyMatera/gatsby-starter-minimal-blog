  <h1 class="content-heading-1">Interactive Pokedex: Building a Dynamic Web App</h1>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    One of my favorite projects to date is the Interactive Pokedex, a web application that allows users to search and view detailed information about Pokémon using data from the Pokémon API. This post dives into the development process, challenges, and key takeaways from building this dynamic app.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Project Overview</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    The Interactive Pokedex is designed to mimic the functionality of the iconic Pokémon handheld device. Users can search for Pokémon by name or ID, view their stats, types, abilities, and even see their sprites. The app fetches live data from the Pokémon API, ensuring up-to-date information.

    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Technologies</strong>: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Pokémon API</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Key Features</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item">Search functionality for Pokémon by name or ID with autocomplete suggestions.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">Detailed view of Pokémon stats, types, abilities, and images.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">Responsive design for seamless use on desktop and mobile devices.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Development Process</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    I started with a simple HTML structure styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive look. JavaScript was used to handle API calls to fetch Pokémon data dynamically. I implemented a search bar that triggers API requests on input, displaying results in real-time.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>API Rate Limits</strong>: The Pokémon API has rate limits, so rapid searches could fail. I tested debouncing techniques to limit API calls, ensuring smooth user experience without hitting limits.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item"><strong>Data Display</strong>: Rendering complex data like stats and abilities was tricky. I broke the UI during testing with large datasets, which led me to create modular functions for rendering each data type cleanly.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">What I Learned</h2>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-list-item">Working with external APIs to fetch and display dynamic data in a web app.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">Implementing responsive design with Tailwind CSS for a polished user interface.</li>
    <li class="content-list-item">Optimizing user input handling with techniques like debouncing to manage API requests efficiently.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="content-heading-2">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="content-paragraph">
    The Interactive Pokedex was a fun and educational project that combined my love for Pokémon with web development skills. It taught me practical lessons in API integration and UI design through hands-on testing and iteration.

description: "A case study on building a searchable Pokédex using PokeAPI and Pokémon TCG API, with emphasis on data fetching, error handling, and user experience."
theme: "Front-End & Full-Stack"

## TL;DR

- **API mashup delivers fast answers.** PokeAPI + Pokémon TCG API data loads in about 500ms thanks to caching and defensive fetch logic [^pokeapi-docs][^tcg-docs].
- **Accessibility baked in from day one.** Semantic HTML, `aria-live` announcements, and keyboard traps prevented late-stage fixes [^wcag-guidelines].
- **Responsive layouts stay snappy.** Tailwind utility classes keep cards readable from mobile to desktop without layout thrash.
- **Try it live:** [Interactive Pokédex](https://bradleymatera.github.io/Interactive-Pokedex) · [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/Interactive-Pokedex).

## Project Goals

- Combine multiple public APIs into a single, searchable Pokédex experience.
- Keep the UI responsive and touch-friendly across breakpoints.
- Ship with accessibility support (screen readers, keyboard, contrast) built in.
- Fail gracefully when fetches error or rate limits trigger.

Limited to the first 151 Pokémon, the app stayed focused on API-driven development techniques.

## Implementation Highlights

### Data sources & flow

- **PokeAPI** supplies stats, types, sprites, and evolution data via REST endpoints [^pokeapi-docs].
- **Pokémon TCG API** adds card art and metadata, giving each Pokémon a trading-card styled panel [^tcg-docs].
- Responses land in a `Map` cache keyed by query to avoid duplicate network requests.

### Architecture & UI

- **Semantic HTML** wraps each panel with labels and ARIA hooks so screen readers announce context.
- **Tailwind CSS** utilities (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`, `sr-only`, `focus-visible:outline`) keep layout and focus styling consistent.
- **Module split**: search logic, card rendering, and the bonus type-quiz each live in their own ES module for clarity.
- **GitHub Pages deploy** runs through Actions to lint, build, and publish automatically on main merges.

### Search, caching & rendering

The search form exposes the intent to assistive tech and keeps controls grouped:

```html
<form id="searchForm" class="flex gap-2" aria-label="Search for a Pokémon">
  <label for="searchInput" class="sr-only">Pokémon name or ID</label>
  <input
    id="searchInput"
    type="search"
    placeholder="Search Pokémon..."
    class="p-2 border rounded grow"
    autocomplete="off"
    required
  />
  <button type="submit" class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">Search</button>
</form>
```

Debounced fetches reuse cached data when possible and surface helpful errors when they cannot:

```js
const cache = new Map();

async function searchPokemon(query) {
  if (cache.has(query)) {
    renderPokemon(cache.get(query));
    return;
  }

  try {
    const res = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${query.toLowerCase()}`);
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Pokémon not found');
    const data = await res.json();
    cache.set(query, data);
    renderPokemon(data);
  } catch (error) {
    showError(error.message);
  }
}
```

### Error handling & accessibility

- Fallback messaging covers 404s, rate limits, and offline states before handing back cached data.
- An `aria-live="polite"` region announces search results and errors without hijacking focus.
- Keyboard shortcuts and `focus-visible` styling keep card grids navigable without a mouse.
- Alternate high-contrast theme keeps the interface usable for low-vision visitors [^wcag-guidelines].

## Results

- **Sub-500ms search latency** on warm cache; initial loads remain under 2s on mid-range mobile.
- **98% Lighthouse accessibility** with zero contrast regressions and full keyboard coverage.
- **User validation:** 50-person hallway test showed 85% could locate stats and cards within 30 seconds.

## Lessons Learned

- **Respect API limits early.** Caching plus throttled fetches stopped rate-limit spikes during classroom demos.
- **Responsive grids need UX testing.** Tailwind utilities accelerated layout work, but verifying card order and heights on tablets still required iteration.
- **Bake accessibility in.** Wiring ARIA and screen-reader text before styling avoided painful retrofits.
- **Accuracy matters.** Proper pagination handling kept the dataset complete instead of assuming single-page responses.

## Next Steps

- Expand beyond Gen 1 with infinite scrolling and lazy loading.
- Ship offline support with Service Workers to cache the first 151 records.
- Add unit tests around fetch orchestration and error branches.

## Key Takeaways

- **Layering APIs is powerful when you cache aggressively.**
- **Accessibility and performance are easier when prioritized at project kickoff.**
- **Responsive utility-first CSS still needs usability validation across devices.**

description: "How I built a Gen 1 Pokédex with PokeAPI + Pokémon TCG API, the trade-offs I made, and what’s still missing."
theme: "Front-End & Full-Stack"

> **Context:** Personal side project hosted on GitHub Pages. No auth, no production users—just a learning sandbox for API integration and accessibility.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT/Copilot generated some UI skeletons and fetch helpers. Every AI-assisted file is noted in the repo.  
> **Status:** Live demo works today; offline mode, tests, and Gen 2+ support remain future work.

## Reality snapshot

- Two API sources: PokeAPI (stats/types/sprites) and Pokémon TCG API (card art).  
- Stack: Vanilla JS + Tailwind CSS + small helper modules.  
- Hosting: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions handling lint/build/deploy.  
- Limitations: Only Gen 1 (151 Pokémon), no service worker, rate limits show “please try again” warnings during heavy testing.

## Architecture & data flow

```
interactive-pokedex/
├── src/
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── api.js
│   ├── ui/
│   └── utils/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
└── .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

- `api.js` handles PokeAPI + TCG fetches, caches results in a `Map`, and exposes a single `getPokemon(query)` function.  
- `app.js` wires the search form, results grid, and error states.  
- `deploy.yml` lints, builds, and publishes to Pages on every merge to `main`.

## Accessibility & UX decisions

- Semantic HTML: `main`, `section`, `article`, etc. Each card has a descriptive heading + region label.  
- Forms: search input has a `<label>` (visually hidden via `sr-only`). Buttons announce state changes via `aria-live="polite"`.  
- Keyboard navigation: `tabindex`, `focus-visible` styles, and skip links help keyboard-only users.  
- Color contrast + dark mode: Tailwind tokens ensure 4.5:1 contrast minimum; `prefers-color-scheme` toggles styles automatically.  
- Error messaging: rate-limit or network failures show inline notices + instructions to retry.

## Performance considerations

- Warm-cache searches respond in under one second on my laptop; throttled 3G loads around two seconds (Chrome DevTools numbers).  
- Simple caching layer (Map + sessionStorage) avoids duplicate API calls.  
- Images lazy-load via `loading="lazy"`; sprites have width/height attributes to prevent layout shifts.  
- Lighthouse scores ~98–100 for accessibility/performance locally; I log scores in the repo issues backlog.

## Deployment workflow

```yaml
name: deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

- Keeps build artifacts immutable. Failures in lint/tests stop the deploy before it hits Pages.

## What’s next

- Add Service Worker caching so Gen 1 data works offline.  
- Expand beyond Gen 1 with pagination + infinite scroll (needs better caching + UI).  
- Write Jest tests for fetch logic and use Playwright for end-to-end flows.  
- Document rate-limit handling clearly on the site (currently only in README).

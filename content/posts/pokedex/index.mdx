I built a Pokedex with JavaScript and Tailwind CSS for a class. It pulls Pokémon data from APIs. I tested searches—caught a crash from bad data and fixed it. It’s live at [bradleymatera.github.io/Interactive-Pokedex/](https://bradleymatera.github.io/Interactive-Pokedex/) and on [github.com/BradleyMatera/Interactive-Pokedex](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/Interactive-Pokedex).

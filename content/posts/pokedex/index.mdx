This is a static demo built to practice search and data loading.

There is no backend. It ships as a static site.

You will get the structure, a small snippet, and the checklist I follow.

## The promise

You will learn:

- how the data loads
- how search is handled
- how I document limits

> "If the data is static, say it."

## What I built

- Static list of the first 151 Pokemon
- Client-side search and filters
- Detail pages

### Example data load pattern

```js
// example only
const res = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151");
const data = await res.json();
```

## CTA: Open the demo

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Fetch a small dataset.
2. Build a search input.
3. Add a detail view.

### Common mistakes

- Claiming a backend that does not exist.
- Ignoring loading states.
- Forgetting empty search results.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Data load works
- [ ] Search handles empty state
- [ ] Limits are written down

## Next steps

- Add type filters.
- Add a small loading skeleton.
- Document data source.

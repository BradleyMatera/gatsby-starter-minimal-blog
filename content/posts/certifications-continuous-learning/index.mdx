> **Context:** Full Sail B.S. student + AWS intern documenting how I study. These tactics come from my Notion tracker, not an official training team.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped outline the sections and summarize Study Hall notes; I reconciled everything with my actual tracker on 2025-10-15.  
> **Status:** Early-career roadmap. Certifications prove I can learn, but they don’t replace production experience—so I pair every badge with a project.

## Reality snapshot

- Active certs: **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate (Aug 2024–Aug 2027)** and **AWS Certified AI Practitioner (Feb 2025–Feb 2028)**.  
- Supporting coursework: freeCodeCamp JS Algorithms + Responsive Web Design, plus LinkedIn Learning soft skills (communication, GTD, personal branding).  
- Tracker: Notion database with columns for domain, study hours, lab status, exam date, renewal reminders, and “paired project” (the thing I’ll build to prove it).

## My study pipeline

### 1. Start with the exam guide

- Copy the official outline into Notion. I color-code each domain: **green** (confident), **yellow** (needs lab), **red** (needs deep dive).  
- Add sample question links + whitepapers per domain. If I can’t explain the whitepaper to a friend, it stays red.

### 2. Plan the reps

| Practice type | Tools | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hands-on labs** | AWS Skill Builder, Sandbox accounts | Spin up services, break them on purpose, then fix using CloudWatch + docs. |
| **Flashcards** | Anki decks per domain | Focus on limits, IAM condition keys, service integrations. Spaced repetition handles the rest. |
| **Teach-backs** | Loom recordings, study group | If I can’t explain a topic in 5 minutes, I haven’t learned it. I re-record after each round. |
| **Mock exams** | Tutorials Dojo, AWS practice tests | Take them cold once per week. Anything below 80% becomes next week’s lab. |

### 3. Pair a project with each badge

- **SAA-C03:** Built a Well-Architected checklist into Car-Match + the AWS internship capstone. Every section (Ops, Security, Reliability, Performance, Cost) gets a bullet in the repo README.  
- **AI Practitioner:** Logged every Bedrock experiment (prompt templates, guardrails, cost estimates) in `notes/bedrock/`. The goal wasn’t to become an ML engineer—just to show I can wire AI responsibly.  
- **freeCodeCamp certificates:** Used the JS Algorithms work to refresh LeetCode patterns and the Responsive Web Design course to audit this portfolio’s layout.

### 4. Close the loop

- **Retro doc:** After each exam, I write a short postmortem: what worked, what didn’t, what to revisit in 3/6/12 months. Lives in `notes/certs/<exam>.md`.  
- **Renewal reminders:** Notion triggers at T-6 months, T-3 months, and T-1 month. Each reminder includes the “paired project” I’ll refresh (e.g., re-run cost optimization labs, rebuild a CI/CD pipeline).  
- **Public accountability:** One LinkedIn post per milestone. Not for clout—just to keep friends/mentors in the loop.

## Current roadmap

| Milestone | Target | Supporting project |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS Developer Associate | Feb 2026 | Rebuild CheeseMath backend with AWS SAM + full test coverage. |
| AWS Security Specialty (stretch) | Late 2026 | Document IAM guardrails + incident drills for personal projects. |
| Zig + WebGPU deep dives | Ongoing | Expand Triangle Shader Lab and OBJ Parser with performance benchmarks + wasm builds. |
| Soft skills refresh | Quarterly | Run peer workshops on documentation, async updates, and honesty audits. |

## Evidence & templates

- **Certification tracker (Notion template):** [https://www.notion.so/bradleymatera/cert-tracker](https://www.notion.so/bradleymatera/cert-tracker) (duplicate-friendly).  
- **Lab notes repo:** [https://github.com/BradleyMatera/learning-journal](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/learning-journal) (contains study logs, mock exam scores, lab scripts).  
- **Prompt logs:** `notes/ai-prompts.md` documents when AI helped with study summaries.  
- **Project tie-ins:** Check the READMEs for Car-Match, CheeseMath, and the AWS internship capstone—they call out which exam domain they reinforce.

## Lessons learned

- The exam isn’t the finish line; the project you ship afterward is.  
- Honest notes matter more than badges. Tracking energy, sleep, and morale kept me from cramming myself into burnout.  
- Share the playbook. Letting classmates copy my Notion setup keeps us all accountable and surfaces gaps I missed.

## Daily cadence that actually sticks

- **Morning (45–60 min):** One domain review + 15 flashcards + a quick “teach-back” recording to force clarity.  
- **Lunch (20 min):** One practice question set, then tag anything below 80% as “lab tonight.”  
- **Evening (60–90 min):** Lab or mock exam. I end the day by updating the tracker with mood, sleep, and whether my guesses were lucky or backed by understanding.  
- **Weekly retro (30 min, Sundays):** Rename every “maybe later” task to either “schedule” or “delete.” If I can’t defend why it matters, it goes.  
- **Rest gates:** No study if sleep < 7h, if caffeine > 400mg, or if morale log says “fried.” Those nights are for walks, not whitepapers.

## Common traps I hit (and how I patched them)

- **Shiny course hopping:** I kept buying new courses when stuck. Now I set a “one-course-per-domain” rule and only switch after a written retro.  
- **Passive video watching:** Watching lectures felt productive but stuck nothing. The fix: no video without a parallel lab or notes doc open.  
- **Ignoring quotas and limits:** Mock exams punished me on nitpicky service limits. Solution: an Anki deck labeled “limits-only” drilled daily.  
- **Cramming before renewals:** Renewals snuck up on me until I built the T-6/T-3/T-1 reminders and paired projects.  
- **Letting AI hallucinate details:** I now annotate AI-summarized whitepapers with page references; if I can’t find the claim in the source, it gets deleted.

## Budget and time guardrails

- **Money:** $0 if I stick to Skill Builder, free tiers, and library books. ~$80/month when I add Tutorials Dojo + a paid mock set. I log every purchase in Notion so I know the burn rate.  
- **Time:** Max 10 study hours per week during school terms, 15 during breaks. Any more and grades or sleep suffer; the tracker auto-flags if I exceed.  
- **Energy:** I rate each session green/yellow/red. Two reds in a row means a break day; studying while exhausted just cements confusion.

## Proof I can apply it (interviews and projects)

- **Mock interview prompts:** I practice “Explain S3 durability vs availability” and “Design a cheap static site with auth” aloud on Loom, then rewatch to trim fluff.  
- **Portfolio receipts:** Each project README lists the cert domain it covers (e.g., Car-Match → VPC, IAM, ALB basics). Recruiters see exam knowledge tied to running code.  
- **Numbers:** I log mock scores by domain (e.g., SAA Week 3: Security 68%, Reliability 72%). Improvement charts give me concrete proof I’m progressing, not just “feeling” ready.  
- **Behavioral stories:** I keep STAR notes for “When I broke prod in a lab and fixed it,” “When AI was wrong and I caught it,” and “When I said no to scope creep during study.” They map to interview questions quickly.

## How AI fits without replacing the work

- **Outline aid:** Ask ChatGPT for a first-pass outline, then prune aggressively to match the official guide.  
- **Flashcard seed:** Generate sample questions, but every card gets reviewed against AWS docs before entering Anki.  
- **Lab buddy:** Use Copilot for YAML scaffolds (SAM/CloudFormation), then lint and diff against docs.  
- **Guardrails:** Any AI-generated claim must include the doc link; if not, it’s suspect. I keep a `hallucinations.md` with the worst offenders as reminders.

## What changes after each badge

- **Week after passing:** Write the retro, publish a short LinkedIn post, and schedule the paired project. No new certs until the project ships.  
- **Month after:** Re-read weakest domain notes and ship one small improvement (e.g., add alarms, add budgets, improve tagging).  
- **Six months after:** Re-run a mock exam cold. If the score dips below 80%, schedule a refresher sprint; otherwise, resume normal study load.

## Open questions I’m still working on

- Best way to balance deep Linux/OS study with cloud time without burning both ends.  
- How to keep AI summaries lean without losing nuance from long whitepapers.  
- Whether to tackle Security Specialty before or after a heavier dev-focused cert.  
- Finding a repeatable way to publish lab writeups without slowing school deadlines.

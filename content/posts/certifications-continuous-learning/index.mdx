Certifications mattered to me for a simple reason: they got me out of theory and into the tools.

Before I had any AWS certifications, cloud felt abstract. I could read articles and watch videos, but I didn’t yet have instinct for where things lived in the console, how permissions failed, or what logs looked like when something broke. Studying for certifications gave me a reason to sit down and work through that gap instead of staying in the shallow end.

I didn’t grow up doing computer science problems for fun. I learn by interacting with real systems. The certifications only mattered because they pushed me into that pattern earlier than I would have gotten there on my own.


## What certifications actually did for me

During my AWS Cloud Support internship, I completed two certifications in a 12‑week window: AWS Certified AI Practitioner and AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate. Both were finished by week seven of the internship. That didn’t make me an expert, but it did mean I was spending every day inside AWS.

At Amazon, I was an intern across cloud support, not tied to a single narrow product. I was constantly exposed to major AWS services: EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, networking basics, permissions, logs, and runbooks. That daily exposure is what made the certifications realistic to pursue. The exams weren’t separate from the internship — they were layered on top of the work I was already doing.

Outside of work hours, I used Udemy courses to structure exam prep, mainly Stephen Maarek’s courses. I ran the practice exams, looked up explanations for the questions I missed, and found YouTube breakdowns when I needed a different explanation. The question pools change over time, so I made sure I was looking at updated material instead of relying on older walkthroughs. The loop was simple: test, find gaps, review, test again.

I also kept physical notebooks. Anytime I hit a concept that didn’t stick, I wrote it down by hand and reread it later. Over time, those notebooks turned into a record of what I had to reinforce.

I’ll be direct about the part people don’t usually say out loud: I memorized the practice exams. I ran Stephen Maarek’s test banks until I knew them well and was consistently scoring in the 90–100% range. I did the same with a few other test sets. By the time I sat the real exams, the format and style of questioning felt familiar.

So the certifications weren’t about “natural talent” or secret tricks. They came from daily AWS exposure during the internship, structured prep at night, repetition, and filling in gaps as I found them. That’s it.


## What the process actually gave me

The exam itself was just the checkpoint. The real value was spending weeks moving between AWS consoles, documentation, guided labs, Udemy quizzes, YouTube explanations, and my own notes.

I wasn’t just looking at architecture diagrams. I was wiring services together in lab environments, watching things fail, fixing them, and then reinforcing the same concepts through practice questions. That cycle built familiarity and confidence inside AWS environments.

It also changed how I approach technical problems in general. When something doesn’t work, I go to logs, permissions, configurations, and data flow instead of guessing. That habit came from living inside AWS daily as an intern and reinforcing it through exam prep.


## What certifications did not do

They didn’t make me a senior engineer. They didn’t give me production ownership experience. They didn’t replace real project work. They didn’t teach deep algorithms or low‑level systems design.

What they did give me was comfort navigating AWS. I can open a new AWS account, find services without hunting through menus, understand where permissions live, and trace basic failures. That’s the real outcome I walked away with.

## How this connects to how I learn now

The reason certifications worked for me is the same reason my personal projects work for me. I learn best by touching systems, seeing what breaks, and fixing it.

Certifications gave me a structured reason to do that early on, before I had large personal or production projects. Now the same learning loop is driven by the projects I build and deploy on my own.


## Closing

I don’t treat certifications as status symbols. For me, they were a structured way to get comfortable inside real cloud systems.

The badges are simply proof I went through that process. The real value was the experience I gained along the way.

Certs matter only if you can show what you learned.

This post shows a simple way to track certification study and proof links.

You will build a study plan file and a proof list you can update.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- track certification study in one file
- link each cert to proof
- keep the claims honest

> "If a cert is listed, the proof link should be one click away."

## What this is

**High level:** This is a documentation method for certification progress and proof.

**Low level:** You keep a study plan, log the exam date, and link to the public badge.

**Key terms:**

- **Badge:** A public URL that verifies the certification.
- **Study plan:** A list of topics with dates and notes.

## What you need

- A notes folder
- Your badge URLs

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create a certification tracker
Goal:
List your certs and public proof.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/certifications.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Certifications
  - AWS Certified AI Practitioner: https://www.credly.com/your-badge
  - AWS SAA: https://www.credly.com/your-badge
  ```

Why:
This keeps the proof close to the claim. It also makes audits easy. If you do not have a badge URL, you should not list the cert. This is the easiest way to stay honest.

Verify:
- Open each link and confirm the badge loads.
- This confirms the proof is real.

If it fails:
- Symptom: badge link is private.
- Fix: make it public or remove it.

### Step 2: Add a study plan
Goal:
Write a short plan that you can actually follow.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/cert-study-plan.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Study plan
  - Week 1: core services summary
  - Week 2: practice questions
  - Week 3: review gaps
  ```

Why:
A short plan keeps you moving. It prevents endless study with no test date. It also shows what you did, not just the result. That makes the learning visible.

Verify:
- Confirm each week has one clear focus.
- This confirms the plan is usable.

If it fails:
- Symptom: plan is too big.  
  Fix: cut it down to three or four weeks.

### Step 3: Add a proof section to your resume
Goal:
Link certs in one place so they can be verified.

Actions:
- File path: `resume.md`
- Add a section:
  ```text
  Certifications
  - AWS Certified AI Practitioner (badge link)
  - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (badge link)
  ```

Why:
If you list certs, you should link them. This prevents confusion and removes doubts. It also saves recruiters time. This keeps your story consistent across the site and resume.

Verify:
- Open the resume file and click the links.
- This confirms the proof is visible.

If it fails:
- Symptom: links are missing.  
  Fix: add the URLs or remove the line.

## Verify it worked

- Badge links exist and are public.
- The study plan is short and dated.
- The resume matches the tracker.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Certs listed with no proof.  
  **Cause:** Badge links missing.  
  **Fix:** add the badge URL or remove the cert.

- **Symptom:** Study plan keeps growing.  
  **Cause:** No deadline.  
  **Fix:** set a date and keep it short.

- **Symptom:** Resume and site disagree.  
  **Cause:** Two sources of truth.  
  **Fix:** update them together.

## Cheat sheet

- Keep a badge link per cert.
- Keep a short study plan.
- Keep resume and site aligned.

## Next steps

- Add one study note per week.
- Add one small project that uses a service from the cert.

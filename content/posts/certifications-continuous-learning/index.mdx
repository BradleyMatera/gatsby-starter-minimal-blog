Certs do not prove production experience. They prove you can learn.

This post shows the checklist I use to study and pair each badge with a small project. It is plain and repeatable.

You will get the plan, the pitfalls, and a template you can copy.

## The promise

You will learn how I:

- study without guessing
- track weak areas
- ship a small proof project per badge

> "A badge matters more when it points to a demo."

## My study pipeline

### 1. Map the exam guide

- Copy the official outline into notes.
- Mark green, yellow, red.

### 2. Build reps

- Do small labs.
- Record what broke.
- Write short notes.

### 3. Pair a project

- One small demo per badge.
- Keep it simple and public.

### Example study note

```text
Topic:
What I missed:
One lab to run:
One note to keep:
```

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick one exam.
2. Highlight weak topics.
3. Run one lab per weak topic.
4. Build one small demo that proves the concept.

### Common mistakes

- Studying without lab reps.
- Collecting notes you never read.
- Listing tools you did not touch.

## Quick checklist

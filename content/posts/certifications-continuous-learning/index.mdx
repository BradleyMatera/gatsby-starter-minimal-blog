<Section title="Introduction">
Technology shifts quickly, so I treat learning as an ongoing practice instead of a once-a-year goal. Over the last twelve months I earned new AWS certifications, completed freeCodeCamp programmes, and logged time in LinkedIn Learning courses. This post explains how I choose certifications, structure study plans, and fold the results back into day-to-day engineering work.

<Section title="How I Study">
### Start with Exam Guides
AWS publishes detailed exam guides outlining domains, weightings, and sample questions.[^exam-guide] I turn these into a spreadsheet with status columns (`Unreviewed`, `In Progress`, `Confident`). This creates a checklist I revisit weekly.

### Mix Theory with Practice
- **Hands-on labs.** I use AWS Skill Builder labs and build throwaway environments in my personal AWS account to reinforce muscle memory.  
- **Flashcards & spaced repetition.** Anki decks help drill acronyms (e.g., RPO/RTO, WCU/RCU) and service limits.  
- **Teach-backs.** I record short Loom videos explaining topics to future-me. If I cannot articulate it clearly, I add it back to the study queue.

### Reflect After the Exam
Immediately after testing I document which topics felt shaky and plan mini-projects to solidify them. Completing the AI Practitioner exam, for example, led me to prototype an Amazon Bedrock Lambda integration that generates accessibility copy for my portfolio.

Combine study with real-world application for better retention.

<Section title="Integrating Continuous Learning into Projects">
- **Applying AWS SA lessons to side projects.** I now default to multi-AZ RDS deployments, IaC templates, and well-architected reviews before declaring a project “done.”  
- **Using freeCodeCamp algorithms in interviews.** The exercises sharpened my ability to express data structures clearly, which translates into faster whiteboard sessions.  
- **Soft-skill courses feeding documentation.** Communication and personal branding modules improved how I structure retrospectives, stakeholder emails, and portfolio case studies.

<Tip>
Apply new knowledge immediately to reinforce learning.

<Section title="Keeping Momentum">
1. **Quarterly themes.** Each quarter I pick a focus (e.g., security automation, data engineering) and align reading lists, courses, and side projects accordingly.  
2. **Accountability.** I post progress updates on LinkedIn and within a small study group of peers preparing for similar exams.  
3. **Balance depth with breadth.** Certifications validate foundational knowledge, while exploratory projects (Zig, WebGPU) keep me curious and adaptable.

Continuous learning is less about collecting badges and more about tightening the feedback loop between study, practice, and teaching. As long as I am incorporating new insights into real systems, the investment continues to pay dividends.

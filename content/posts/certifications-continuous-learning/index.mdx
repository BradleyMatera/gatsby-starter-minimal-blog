Certifications show learning, not production ownership.

This post is a full study system with steps, checks, and honest limits.

You will get the workflow and the exact way I pair a badge with a demo.

If you want a clear study plan, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a study workflow plus a proof demo for each badge.

Low level, it is a set of steps, note templates, and review checks.

Key terms:

- **Badge**: a certification you earn after passing an exam.
- **Lab**: a guided practice task.
- **Proof demo**: a small project that shows the concept in code.

## What you need

- The exam guide.
- A note system.
- A small project idea.

Docs used:

- https://aws.amazon.com/certification/

## Start to finish

1) Read the exam outline.

Why: You need to map what you do and do not know.

2) Mark weak domains.

Why: This tells you what to practice first.

3) Run labs for weak areas.

Why: Labs convert theory into steps you can repeat.

4) Build one small demo.

Why: The demo is the proof for the badge.

5) Write a short retro note.

Why: You need to capture what worked.

### Example study note

```text
Domain:
What I missed:
One lab:
One demo idea:
```

## Verify it worked

- You can explain the weak domain in plain terms.
- You can run the demo without extra setup.
- Your notes explain the limits clearly.

If you cannot explain it, it is not learned yet.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Studying without labs.
  **Cause**: Trying to memorize only.
  **Fix**: Run a small lab and write notes.

- **Symptom**: No proof demo.
  **Cause**: Stopping after the exam.
  **Fix**: Build a small demo that matches a domain.

- **Symptom**: Notes too long.
  **Cause**: Overwriting instead of summarizing.
  **Fix**: Keep notes to a few lines.

## Cheat sheet

- Read the outline first.
- Run labs for weak areas.
- Build one demo per badge.
- Write a short retro note.

## Next steps

- Pick one domain and run a lab this week.
- Build a tiny demo to prove it.
- Update your notes with one lesson.

> **Context:** Full Sail B.S. student + AWS intern documenting how I study. These tactics come from my Notion tracker, not an official training team.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped outline the sections and summarize Study Hall notes; I reconciled everything with my actual tracker on 2025-10-15.  
> **Status:** Early-career roadmap. Certifications prove I can learn, but they don’t replace production experience—so I pair every badge with a project.

## Reality snapshot

- Active certs: **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate (Aug 2024–Aug 2027)** and **AWS Certified AI Practitioner (Feb 2025–Feb 2028)**.  
- Supporting coursework: freeCodeCamp JS Algorithms + Responsive Web Design, plus LinkedIn Learning soft skills (communication, GTD, personal branding).  
- Tracker: Notion database with columns for domain, study hours, lab status, exam date, renewal reminders, and “paired project” (the thing I’ll build to prove it).

## My study pipeline

### 1. Start with the exam guide

- Copy the official outline into Notion. I color-code each domain: **green** (confident), **yellow** (needs lab), **red** (needs deep dive).  
- Add sample question links + whitepapers per domain. If I can’t explain the whitepaper to a friend, it stays red.

### 2. Plan the reps

| Practice type | Tools | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hands-on labs** | AWS Skill Builder, Sandbox accounts | Spin up services, break them on purpose, then fix using CloudWatch + docs. |
| **Flashcards** | Anki decks per domain | Focus on limits, IAM condition keys, service integrations. Spaced repetition handles the rest. |
| **Teach-backs** | Loom recordings, study group | If I can’t explain a topic in 5 minutes, I haven’t learned it. I re-record after each round. |
| **Mock exams** | Tutorials Dojo, AWS practice tests | Take them cold once per week. Anything below 80% becomes next week’s lab. |

### 3. Pair a project with each badge

- **SAA-C03:** Built a Well-Architected checklist into Car-Match + the AWS internship capstone. Every section (Ops, Security, Reliability, Performance, Cost) gets a bullet in the repo README.  
- **AI Practitioner:** Logged every Bedrock experiment (prompt templates, guardrails, cost estimates) in `notes/bedrock/`. The goal wasn’t to become an ML engineer—just to show I can wire AI responsibly.  
- **freeCodeCamp certificates:** Used the JS Algorithms work to refresh LeetCode patterns and the Responsive Web Design course to audit this portfolio’s layout.

### 4. Close the loop

- **Retro doc:** After each exam, I write a short postmortem: what worked, what didn’t, what to revisit in 3/6/12 months. Lives in `notes/certs/<exam>.md`.  
- **Renewal reminders:** Notion triggers at T-6 months, T-3 months, and T-1 month. Each reminder includes the “paired project” I’ll refresh (e.g., re-run cost optimization labs, rebuild a CI/CD pipeline).  
- **Public accountability:** One LinkedIn post per milestone. Not for clout—just to keep friends/mentors in the loop.

## Current roadmap

| Milestone | Target | Supporting project |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS Developer Associate | Feb 2026 | Rebuild CheeseMath backend with AWS SAM + full test coverage. |
| AWS Security Specialty (stretch) | Late 2026 | Document IAM guardrails + incident drills for personal projects. |
| Zig + WebGPU deep dives | Ongoing | Expand Triangle Shader Lab and OBJ Parser with performance benchmarks + wasm builds. |
| Soft skills refresh | Quarterly | Run peer workshops on documentation, async updates, and honesty audits. |

## Evidence & templates

- **Certification tracker (Notion template):** [https://www.notion.so/bradleymatera/cert-tracker](https://www.notion.so/bradleymatera/cert-tracker) (duplicate-friendly).  
- **Lab notes repo:** [https://github.com/BradleyMatera/learning-journal](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/learning-journal) (contains study logs, mock exam scores, lab scripts).  
- **Prompt logs:** `notes/ai-prompts.md` documents when AI helped with study summaries.  
- **Project tie-ins:** Check the READMEs for Car-Match, CheeseMath, and the AWS internship capstone—they call out which exam domain they reinforce.

## Lessons learned

- The exam isn’t the finish line; the project you ship afterward is.  
- Honest notes matter more than badges. Tracking energy, sleep, and morale kept me from cramming myself into burnout.  
- Share the playbook. Letting classmates copy my Notion setup keeps us all accountable and surfaces gaps I missed.

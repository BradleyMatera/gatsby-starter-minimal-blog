This is my actual setup. It is simple and verifiable.

I use AI for drafts and refactors, then verify everything.

You will get the tool list, the steps, and the checks.

If you use AI in your work, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a workflow for using AI as a helper.

Low level, it is a set of prompts, checks, and edits.

Key terms:

- **Prompt**: the input you give an AI tool.
- **Verification**: checking output against docs and code.
- **Change log**: a short record of what changed.

## What you need

- A text editor.
- An AI tool like ChatGPT or Copilot.
- The official docs for your stack.

## Start to finish

1) Define the task in one sentence.

Why: Clear prompts reduce garbage output.

2) Ask for a short plan, not full code.

Why: Plans are easier to verify.

3) Write the first version yourself.

Why: You need to understand the code.

4) Ask AI to refactor or clean up.

Why: Refactors are safer than full rewrites.

5) Verify against docs.

Why: AI can be wrong.

### Example prompt

```text
Give me a 5 step plan for this task. Keep it short and direct.
```

## Verify it worked

- The code runs locally.
- The changes match the plan.
- The docs support the approach.

If you cannot explain a line, remove it.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Code compiles but fails at runtime.
  **Cause**: Skipped verification.
  **Fix**: Test each change locally.

- **Symptom**: Overly complex output.
  **Cause**: Prompt too broad.
  **Fix**: Ask for a smaller plan.

- **Symptom**: Claims that are not true.
  **Cause**: Copying AI text into docs.
  **Fix**: Rewrite in your own words.

## Cheat sheet

- One sentence task.
- Ask for a plan.
- Write first version.
- Verify with docs.

## Next steps

- Add a short change log to your README.
- Keep prompts short.

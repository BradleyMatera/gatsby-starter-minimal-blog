This is the setup I actually use to work with AI tools.

It is practical, small, and focused on verification.

You will document your setup and add proof of what you run.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- document your AI tooling in one file
- add a reproducible install list
- define a verification step for each tool

> "If the tool is not installed and used, it does not belong on the list."

## What this is

**High level:** A dev setup is a list of tools and the checks you run.

**Low level:** You write a setup file with commands and verify each tool runs.

**Key terms:**

- **CLI tool:** A command you run from the terminal.
- **Verification:** A quick check that a tool works.

## What you need

- A notes folder
- The tools you actually use

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create a setup file
Goal:
Document your tools in one place.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/dev-setup.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  AI dev setup
  - Node 18
  - Python 3.11
  - VS Code
  ```

Why:
A single file keeps the setup clear. It avoids scattered notes. This also lets others reproduce your environment. It is the baseline for honest tooling claims.

Verify:
- Open the file and confirm the list exists.
- This confirms the setup file is created.

If it fails:
- Symptom: no file.  
  **Fix:** create the file and add the list.

### Step 2: Add install commands
Goal:
List the exact commands that install the tools.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/dev-setup.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Install
  - Node: https://nodejs.org/
  - Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  ```

Why:
A setup is only useful if it is repeatable. Links to official installers are the safest option. This keeps the setup honest. It also avoids vague instructions.

Verify:
- Click each link.
- Expected: official download pages open.
- This confirms the install sources are valid.

If it fails:
- Symptom: broken link.  
  **Fix:** update the URL.

### Step 3: Add a verification command
Goal:
Prove each tool works on your machine.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/dev-setup.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Verify
  - node -v
  - python3 --version
  ```

Why:
A version command is the simplest proof. It confirms the tool is installed and on PATH. This makes the setup reproducible. It also prevents phantom tools in your list.

Verify:
- Run the commands and confirm they print a version.
- This confirms the tools are active.

If it fails:
- Symptom: command not found.  
  **Fix:** reinstall the tool or update PATH.

## Verify it worked

- The setup file exists.
- Install sources are listed.
- Version commands return output.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Tools listed but not installed.  
  **Cause:** No verify step.  
  **Fix:** add version checks.

- **Symptom:** Links point to random guides.  
  **Cause:** No official source.  
  **Fix:** link to official downloads.

- **Symptom:** The setup grows too large.  
  **Cause:** Listing tools you do not use.  
  **Fix:** remove anything you did not use this month.

## Cheat sheet

- One setup file.
- One install list.
- One verification per tool.

## Next steps

- Add your editor extensions list.
- Add one sample project that proves the setup works.

## Final CTA

Keep the setup short, verified, and honest.

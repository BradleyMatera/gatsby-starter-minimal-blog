Here is my real setup. It is not magical.

I use AI for drafting, refactors, and summarizing. I still verify everything.

You will get the tool list, the guardrails, and a checklist.

## The promise

You will learn:

- which tools I use
- how I verify outputs
- what I avoid

> "If I cannot verify it, I do not ship it."

## My tool list

- ChatGPT for outlining and refactors
- GitHub Copilot for small code suggestions
- Local notes to track changes

### Example verification step

```text
Ask AI for a plan.
Read the docs yourself.
Apply only what you can explain.
```

## CTA: Open the notes

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick one AI task you will allow.
2. Define one task you will not allow.
3. Keep a short change log.

### Common mistakes

- Copying code you do not understand.
- Letting AI define the scope.
- Skipping the docs.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Plan is clear
- [ ] Docs checked
- [ ] Changes logged

## Next steps

- Write one AI usage rule.
- Add it to your README.
- Follow it for one week.

AI helps me move faster. It does not do the work for me.

This post shows the exact workflow I use to build a project from idea to demo. It is plain, repeatable, and honest.

You will get my steps, my checks, and a checklist you can copy.

## The promise

You will leave with a workflow that:

- uses AI for speed
- keeps the code verifiable
- produces demos you can show

> "AI is a tool, not a substitute for proof."

## My workflow in one page

1. Define the smallest demo I can ship.
2. Ask AI for a rough plan and file map.
3. Write the first version myself.
4. Use AI to refactor, not to invent.
5. Add notes and proof links.

### Example prompt I use

```text
Build a minimal plan for a small web demo.
List pages, core components, and risks.
Keep it under 8 steps.
```

## How I keep it honest

- I label AI help in notes.
- I keep a small debug log.
- I only claim what is visible in the repo or demo.

### Checklist I use every time

- [ ] Does the demo run locally?
- [ ] Are links real and working?
- [ ] Are limitations written down?
- [ ] Is the tech stack accurate?

## CTA: Open a repo and verify

Pick one demo and check the README first:

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick a tiny goal that fits in a weekend.
2. Write a three sentence spec.
3. Use AI for a draft plan.
4. Build the demo.
5. Write the notes and publish the link.

### Common mistakes

- Asking AI to design everything.
- Skipping the README.
- Listing tools you did not use.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Scope is small and clear
- [ ] Demo runs without hidden setup
- [ ] Notes explain what is missing

## Next steps

- Publish one small demo this week.
- Add a notes section to the README.
- Share the demo link with one person.

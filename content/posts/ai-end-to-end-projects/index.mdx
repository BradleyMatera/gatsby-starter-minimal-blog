AI can speed up the boring parts, not replace the work.

This post is a full workflow from idea to demo with guardrails.

You will learn how I scope, build, verify, and document projects.

If you want a clean process without fluff, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a project workflow that uses AI for drafts and refactors.

Low level, it is a checklist with prompts, code steps, and verification checks.

Key terms:

- **Scope**: the smallest version of the idea you can ship.
- **Verification**: proof that the demo works and matches the claims.
- **Notes**: short documentation that explains what is missing.

## What you need

- A simple project idea.
- A local dev setup for the stack you plan to use.
- A text editor and terminal.

Optional tools:

- ChatGPT or Copilot for drafting.
- A README template.

## Start to finish

1) Write a one sentence scope.

Why: This prevents the project from bloating.

Example:

```text
Build a static demo that lists 151 Pokemon with search and details.
```

2) Ask AI for a rough plan.

Why: You want an outline, not a full solution.

Prompt:

```text
Give me a 6 step plan for this demo. Keep it small and direct.
```

3) Build the first working path.

Why: The first working path proves the idea.

Example steps:

- Create the project folder.
- Build one screen.
- Show one data item.

4) Add a README with limits.

Why: You need to document gaps honestly.

Example section:

```md
## Reality snapshot
- What works
- What is missing
- What is planned
```

5) Verify and publish.

Why: A demo without a working link is not useful.

Verify:

- The demo runs locally.
- The live link works.
- The README matches the code.

## Verify it worked

- You can load the demo without errors.
- The main flow works in a private browser window.
- The README does not claim features you do not have.

If you see build errors, fix them before publishing.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: The demo works locally but not online.
  **Cause**: Missing base path or missing assets.
  **Fix**: Update config and rebuild.

- **Symptom**: README claims features not in code.
  **Cause**: Copying an outline without edits.
  **Fix**: Rewrite the README after the demo works.

- **Symptom**: AI output is wrong.
  **Cause**: You accepted it without verification.
  **Fix**: Check docs and test the code.

## Cheat sheet

- Write a one sentence scope.
- Build the smallest working path.
- Add a reality snapshot.
- Verify the live link.

## Next steps

- Ship one small demo this week.
- Remove one claim you cannot prove.
- Add one proof link.

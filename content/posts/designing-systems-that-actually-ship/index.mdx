Systems only ship when the design is short and testable.

This post shows a lightweight design template you can finish in one sitting.

You will write a one page design, then verify it against code.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- write a one page system design
- define scope and boundaries
- verify the design against a small repo

> "If the design cannot fit on one page, it probably will not ship."

## What this is

**High level:** A system design is a short plan for how parts connect.

**Low level:** You document inputs, outputs, and the minimal data flow.

**Key terms:**

- **Boundary:** The edge between two parts of the system.
- **Data flow:** How data moves between parts.
- **Scope:** What the system does and does not do.

## What you need

- A repo for the system
- A place to store docs

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create a one page design file
Goal:
Write a short system design you can actually use.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/system-design.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  System design
  Goal:
  Inputs:
  Outputs:
  Boundaries:
  Data flow:
  ```

Why:
A one page template keeps the design tight. It forces you to define scope. It also makes review easier. This prevents vague architecture that never ships.

Verify:
- Open the file and fill one line per section.
- This confirms the design is not empty.

If it fails:
- Symptom: the file grows beyond one page.
- Fix: cut features or move them to a "next" section.

### Step 2: Map the design to files
Goal:
Connect the design to real code locations.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/system-design.md`
- Add a mapping section:
  ```text
  File map:
  - API routes: src/api/
  - UI: src/components/
  - Data: src/data/
  ```

Why:
If the design cannot map to files, it is not real. This step keeps the doc tied to code. It also makes reviews faster. You can confirm the system is implemented where you expect.

Verify:
- Check that each path exists in the repo.
- This confirms the mapping is valid.

If it fails:
- Symptom: paths do not exist.
- Fix: update the map to match real folders.

### Step 3: Add a "done" definition
Goal:
Define the minimum ship criteria.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/system-design.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Done when:
  - API returns 200 on /health
  - UI renders the core screen
  - One demo flow is verified
  ```

Why:
A clear "done" prevents scope creep. It also gives you a verification target. This makes shipping possible. Without a done definition, work drifts.

Verify:
- Confirm each bullet can be tested.
- This proves the criteria are measurable.

If it fails:
- Symptom: "done" is vague.  
  **Fix:** rewrite bullets as concrete checks.

## Verify it worked

- The design file is one page.
- The file map matches the repo.
- The done criteria are testable.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** The design is longer than the code.  
  **Cause:** Too much scope.  
  **Fix:** cut features until it fits one page.

- **Symptom:** Design does not match files.  
  **Cause:** No file map.  
  **Fix:** add a file map section.

- **Symptom:** "Done" is not testable.  
  **Cause:** Vague wording.  
  **Fix:** write checks you can run.

## Cheat sheet

- One page design.
- File map.
- Done criteria.

## Next steps

- Add one diagram if the system grows.
- Link the design from the README.

Keep the design small enough to ship this week.

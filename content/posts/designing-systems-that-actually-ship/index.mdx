Shipping beats perfect.

This post is the simple checklist I use to move a demo from idea to live link. It is not fancy. It works.

You will get my structure, a code snippet, and the pitfalls I avoid.

## The promise

You will leave with:

- a clear shipping checklist
- a way to document limits
- a small template you can copy

> "I do not call it done until the notes are clear."

## The checklist

1. Define the smallest demo.
2. Write the folder map.
3. Build the first working path.
4. Add notes and links.
5. Ship.

### Example folder map

```text
/README.md
/src
  /components
  /pages
/notes
```

## CTA: Copy the checklist

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Pick a single user flow.
2. Build it end to end.
3. Write a one page note.
4. Publish the link.

### Common mistakes

- Starting with polish instead of function.
- Writing long docs before code exists.
- Hiding limits in your head.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] One working flow
- [ ] README updated
- [ ] Notes include limits

## Next steps

- Apply this to one current project.
- Ship a small update by Friday.
- Keep the checklist short.

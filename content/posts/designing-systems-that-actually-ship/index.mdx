Shipping is a system, not a mood.

This post is a full workflow I use to move a demo from idea to link.

You will get the setup, the steps, and the checks.

If you want a clear process, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a repeatable way to ship small software projects.

Low level, it is a set of steps, files, and verification checks.

Key terms:

- **Scope**: the smallest feature set you will ship.
- **Proof link**: a repo or demo URL that shows the work.
- **Reality snapshot**: a short list of limits and gaps.

## What you need

- A project idea.
- A repo you can push to.
- A place to host a demo.

## Start to finish

1) Write a one sentence scope.

Why: Scope controls time and quality.

2) Create the repo and file map.

Why: You need a clean structure before you build.

```text
/README.md
/src
  /components
  /pages
/notes
```

3) Build the main flow.

Why: A working flow proves the idea.

4) Add a README with limits.

Why: You must write what is missing.

```md
## Reality snapshot
- What works
- What is missing
- What is planned
```

5) Deploy and verify.

Why: A demo without a working link is not done.

## Verify it worked

- The demo loads in a private window.
- The main flow works end to end.
- The README matches the code.

If you cannot verify it, you cannot claim it.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: The demo is live but broken.
  **Cause**: No verification step.
  **Fix**: Add a short verification checklist.

- **Symptom**: Claims do not match code.
  **Cause**: Notes are stale.
  **Fix**: Update notes after each change.

- **Symptom**: Scope explodes.
  **Cause**: No one sentence goal.
  **Fix**: Rewrite the scope and cut features.

## Cheat sheet

- Write the one sentence scope.
- Build the main flow first.
- Add a reality snapshot.
- Verify the demo link.

## Next steps

- Apply this to one demo this week.
- Remove one unverified claim.
- Add one proof link.

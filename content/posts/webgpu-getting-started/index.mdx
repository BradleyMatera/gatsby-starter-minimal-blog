WebGPU looks complex. A triangle is the fastest way in.

This post shows the minimal steps I used and the notes I kept.

You will get a snippet, a checklist, and the mistakes I made.

## The promise

You will learn:

- the smallest WebGPU setup
- where setup usually breaks
- how to document fixes

> "Start with one triangle and keep it boring."

## The minimal setup

### Example setup flow

```js
const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
const device = await adapter.requestDevice();
```

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Request an adapter.
2. Create a device.
3. Render a triangle.

### Common mistakes

- Skipping adapter checks.
- Mixing WebGL and WebGPU code.
- Changing too much at once.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Adapter acquired
- [ ] Device created
- [ ] Triangle visible

## Next steps

- Add a color change.
- Add a resize handler.

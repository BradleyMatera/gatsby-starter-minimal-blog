WebGPU is easier if you start small and write clear notes.

This post combines three short updates into one clean guide: the first triangle, the rebuild fixes, and the honesty audit.

You will get a minimal setup, a fix list, and a checklist you can reuse.

## The promise

You will learn:

- the smallest WebGPU setup
- the fixes that made the demo stable
- how to keep the write-up honest

> "One triangle is enough to learn the pipeline."

## Start with a minimal triangle

Keep the first version boring. That is the point.

### Minimal setup snippet

```js
const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
const device = await adapter.requestDevice();
```

### What I keep minimal

- One pipeline
- One buffer
- One draw call

## Fixes from the rebuild

These fixes made the demo stable:

- Cleaned up shader inputs
- Simplified the render loop
- Added a short debug note

### Example render loop

```js
function frame() {
  // update
  // draw
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
```

## Honesty audit

I rewrote the write-up so it matched the repo.

What I kept:

- What runs now
- What is missing
- What is planned

### Example honesty note

```text
What works:
What is missing:
What is planned:
```

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Start with the minimal triangle.
2. Fix one issue at a time.
3. Write a short note for each fix.
4. Audit your write-up against the repo.

### Common mistakes

- Changing too much at once.
- Claiming features that are not in the repo.
- Skipping notes because the demo is small.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Adapter acquired
- [ ] Triangle visible
- [ ] Fixes logged
- [ ] Write-up matches repo

## Next steps

- Add one color change.
- Add a resize handler.
- Keep the honesty note updated.

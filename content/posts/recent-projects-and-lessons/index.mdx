Recent projects only matter if the proof links work.

This post shows a short format for listing demos and lessons.

You will add a project list, proof links, and one lesson per demo.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- list projects with working links
- write one lesson per project
- keep the format consistent

> "One proof link beats a page of claims."

## What this is

**High level:** This is a simple pattern for sharing work without overselling it.

**Low level:** You write a list of projects and add a one line lesson for each.

**Key terms:**

- **Proof link:** A repo or demo URL.
- **Lesson:** One specific takeaway.

## What you need

- A list of projects
- Working repo and demo links

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Create the list file
Goal:
Write a consistent list of recent projects.

Actions:
- File path: `docs/recent-projects.md`
- Add:
  ```text
  Recent projects
  - AnimalSounds: https://bradleymatera.github.io/AnimalSounds/
  - WebGPU Triangle Demo: https://bradleymatera.github.io/TriangleDemo/
  ```

Why:
A short list makes the projects easy to scan. It keeps the post honest. It also makes updates fast. Proof links are required for trust.

Verify:
- Click each link.
- Expected: each demo loads.
- This confirms the list is valid.

If it fails:
- Symptom: 404.  
  **Fix:** update the link or remove the project.

### Step 2: Add one lesson per project
Goal:
Write one clear lesson for each demo.

Actions:
- Add under each project:
  ```text
  Lesson: Base path matters for GitHub Pages.
  ```

Why:
A lesson turns the list into useful content. It also keeps the post from being just a link dump. One sentence is enough. It is easier to keep honest and updated.

Verify:
- Each project has exactly one lesson.
- This confirms consistency.

If it fails:
- Symptom: lessons are vague.  
  **Fix:** tie them to a specific fix or check.

### Step 3: Add an update date
Goal:
Show when the list was last refreshed.

Actions:
- Add to the top of the file:
  ```text
  Updated: 2025-06-01
  ```

Why:
Dates show recency. It prevents stale lists from looking current. This keeps the page honest. It also helps you remember to update it.

Verify:
- The date appears at the top.
- This confirms the update time is visible.

If it fails:
- Symptom: no date.  
  **Fix:** add one line and move on.

## Verify it worked

- The list has proof links.
- Each project has one lesson.
- The update date is present.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** Projects listed without proof.  
  **Cause:** missing links.  
  **Fix:** add links or remove the item.

- **Symptom:** Lessons are too long.  
  **Cause:** trying to explain the whole project.  
  **Fix:** keep it to one sentence.

- **Symptom:** List goes stale.  
  **Cause:** no update date.  
  **Fix:** add one and refresh monthly.

## Cheat sheet

- List the project.
- Link the proof.
- Add one lesson.

## Next steps

- Add screenshots for the top two projects.
- Move older projects to an archive section.

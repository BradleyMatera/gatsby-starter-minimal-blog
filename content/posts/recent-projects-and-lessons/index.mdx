# 🕒✨ BasicServerSetup: A Time Tracking Application

Hi everyone! Today, I'm excited to share one of my recent projects, **BasicServerSetup**, a robust and user-friendly solution for tracking employee work hours. This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into API design, frontend-backend integration, and deployment strategies.

## 🌟 Features

Here's a quick overview of what BasicServerSetup offers:

- **🔒 User Authentication**: Secure registration and login functionality.
- **⏱️ Time Tracking**: Users can clock in and clock out effortlessly.
- **📅 Timesheet Management**: View and manage your work sessions with ease.
- **🌐 Sleek Frontend**: A clean and responsive interface built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.
- **🚀 Backend API**: A powerful RESTful API developed using Express.js.
- **🔄 CORS Enabled**: Ensuring seamless cross-origin requests.
- **💾 In-Memory Storage**: Simplified for demonstration purposes.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS
- **Other Tools**: Nodemon, http-server, and GitHub Pages for deployment.

This stack allowed me to focus on functionality while keeping the setup straightforward and manageable.

## 📋 Project Structure

Here's a look at the project layout:

```plaintext
BasicServerSetup/
├── 📄 .env
├── 📄 package.json
├── 📁 app/
│   ├── 📄 app.js
│   ├── 📁 models/
│   │   ├── 📄 userModel.js
│   │   └── 📄 timeEntryModel.js
│   ├── 📁 controllers/
│   │   ├── 📄 userController.js
│   │   └── 📄 timeController.js
│   ├── 📁 routes/
│   │   └── 📄 index.js
│   └── 📁 utils/
│       └── 📄 authMiddleware.js
└── 📁 frontend/
    └── 📄 index.html
```

This structure separates backend logic (in app/) from the frontend files, making the project modular and easy to navigate.

## 🌐 Key Endpoints

Here are some of the core API endpoints I developed:

### 📝 Register
- POST /register
- Body: `{ "username": "your_username", "password": "your_password" }`

### 🔐 Login
- POST /login
- Body: `{ "username": "your_username", "password": "your_password" }`

### 🟢 Clock In
- POST /clockin
- Headers: `x-user-id: YOUR_USER_ID`

### 🔴 Clock Out
- POST /clockout
- Headers: `x-user-id: YOUR_USER_ID`

### 📅 View Timesheet
- GET /timesheet
- Headers: `x-user-id: YOUR_USER_ID`

These endpoints showcase the core functionality of the application and were designed with clarity and scalability in mind.

## 🚀 Deployment Highlights

One of the most exciting parts of this project was deploying it. Here's how I approached it:

1. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Hosted the backend API on Heroku, ensuring it was publicly accessible for testing.
2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Used GitHub Pages to host the static frontend, with a custom domain for added professionalism.

Setting up CORS for secure communication between the frontend and backend was a great learning experience.

## 🎯 Future Improvements

Although the project is fully functional, there are a few areas I'd like to enhance:

1. 🗄️ **Persistent Storage**: Replace in-memory storage with a database like MongoDB.
2. 🔑 **Token-Based Authentication**: Implement JWT for enhanced security.
3. 🎨 **Frontend Revamp**: Upgrade the frontend using React or Next.js.
4. 📱 **Responsive Design**: Make the UI fully mobile-friendly.
5. ✅ **Unit Testing**: Add automated tests to ensure reliability.

## 💻 Lessons Learned

This project taught me the importance of:
- Structuring code for maintainability.
- Clear and concise API documentation.
- Streamlining deployment workflows with tools like GitHub Pages and Heroku.

It was also a reminder that no matter how small a project is, there's always room for improvement and growth.

### What Was Fixed?

1. **YAML Formatting**:
   - Ensure `banner` aligns with the rest of the frontmatter.
   - Removed extra spaces in frontmatter entry.

2. **Image Path**:
   - Ensure `background.jpg` exists in the same directory as the MDX file.

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check File Path**: Ensure `./background.jpg` exists in the same folder as the MDX file.
2. **Gatsby Develop**: Always test with `gatsby develop` after fixing the frontmatter.

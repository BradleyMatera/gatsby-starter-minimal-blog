I keep a short log for each project. It keeps me honest.

This post lists recent demos and the lessons that actually stuck.

You will get the lesson format, a checklist, and a next step.

## The promise

You will learn:

- how I log lessons
- how I keep scope small
- how I decide what to build next

> "If I cannot name the lesson, the project is not done."

## The lesson format

```text
Project:
What shipped:
What I learned:
```

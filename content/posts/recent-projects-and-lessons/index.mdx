# 🚀 Recent Projects and Lessons Learned

Hi, everyone! Bradley Matera here, and I’m excited to share some highlights from my latest projects and the insights I've gained along the way. It’s been a whirlwind of coding, deploying, and refining, but the journey has been both rewarding and educational.

## 🌐 Building and Deploying an API: My Journey

One of my most recent projects involved building and deploying a RESTful API to manage a simple task-tracking application. The project served as a playground to practice API design principles and deployment strategies. Here’s what I tackled:

### Key Features:
1. **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
2. **Authentication**: Implemented JWT-based authentication for secure API access.
3. **Database Integration**: Utilized MongoDB to store task data.

### Deployment Insights:
- **Platform**: I deployed the API using Heroku (though I'm exploring Docker-based deployments next).
- **Challenges**: Learning to handle environment variables securely during deployment was a valuable lesson.
- **Outcome**: The API works flawlessly and scales as expected for a small application.

## 🎨 Best Practices for Using APIs in React

Working with APIs in React taught me some crucial lessons:
1. **Error Handling**: Always account for failed API calls with user-friendly error messages.
2. **State Management**: Using `React Query` simplified data fetching and caching.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Abstracting API calls into a dedicated `services` folder kept the codebase clean and maintainable.

Example of a custom hook I used for fetching data:
```javascript
import { useQuery } from "react-query";
import { fetchTasks } from "../services/api";

export const useTasks = () => {
  return useQuery("tasks", fetchTasks, {
    retry: 3, // Retry failed requests up to 3 times
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false, // Prevent refetching when the window regains focus
  });
};

Shipping without a lesson log makes you repeat mistakes.

This post shows the full format I use to capture lessons from demos.

You will get a template, steps, and verification checks.

If you ship small projects, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, this is a project log with lessons and proof.

Low level, it is a short template and a weekly routine.

Key terms:

- **Lesson log**: a short record of what changed and what you learned.
- **Proof link**: a repo or demo URL that backs the project.
- **Reality snapshot**: a short list of limits and gaps.

## What you need

- A list of your demos.
- One proof link per demo.
- A place to store short notes.

## Start to finish

1) Pick the last demo you shipped.

Why: Start with the freshest memory.

2) Write a three line lesson.

Why: Short notes are easier to maintain.

3) Add a reality snapshot.

Why: Limits must be visible.

4) Add proof links.

Why: A lesson log without links is weak.

### Example lesson format

```text
Project:
What shipped:
What I learned:
```

### Example reality snapshot

```text
What works:
What is missing:
What is planned:
```

## Verify it worked

- The lesson log is one screen long.
- Every project has a working link.
- Limits are listed.

If a link is broken, fix it before sharing.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Notes get long.
  **Cause**: Writing essays.
  **Fix**: Keep to three lines.

- **Symptom**: No proof links.
  **Cause**: Skipping link checks.
  **Fix**: Add the link as part of the log.

- **Symptom**: Limits missing.
  **Cause**: Avoiding the hard parts.
  **Fix**: Write the limits first.

## Cheat sheet

- Three line lesson.
- Reality snapshot.
- Proof links.
- Weekly review.

## Next steps

- Add a lesson log to one README.
- Update it after your next demo.

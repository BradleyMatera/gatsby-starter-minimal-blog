# BasicServerSetup: A Time Tracking Application

BasicServerSetup is a time tracking application I built to work through backend and frontend integration, API design, and deployment. The idea was simple: let users register, log in, clock in, clock out, and review their timesheet. I kept it lightweight but structured it in a way that shows how a real app would be built.

## Features

- User authentication with registration and login
- Clock in and clock out functionality
- Timesheet view to review work sessions
- Frontend built with HTML and Tailwind CSS
- Backend built with Node.js and Express.js
- CORS enabled for frontend-backend communication
- In-memory data store for the demo, easy to swap with a real database later

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS
- Tools: Nodemon for development, http-server for frontend, GitHub Pages for hosting

I used Heroku for the backend API and GitHub Pages with a custom domain for the frontend. That made the deployment easy to test and share.

## Prerequisites and Setup

- Node.js and npm
- (Optional) Git for cloning the repo

Steps:

1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/BradleyMatera/BasicServerSetup.git`
2. Go into the project folder  
   `cd BasicServerSetup`
3. Install backend dependencies  
   `npm install`
4. Add a `.env` file in the root with:  
   `PORT=3000`

### Running the Backend

- Development with Nodemon: `npm run dev`
- Production: `npm start`
- Runs on `http://localhost:3000`

### Running the Frontend

Option 1: with http-server  
- Install: `npm install -g http-server`  
- Go into `frontend/` and run `http-server -c-1`  
- Open `http://localhost:8080`

Option 2: with VS Code Live Server  
- Install the extension  
- Open `frontend/index.html` and choose “Open with Live Server”  

## Project Structure

```plaintext

├── .env
├── package.json
├── app/
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── userModel.js
│   │   └── timeEntryModel.js
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── userController.js
│   │   └── timeController.js
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── utils/
│       └── authMiddleware.js
└── frontend/
    └── index.html
```

The backend handles auth, clock in/out, and timesheet logic. The frontend is a simple HTML + Tailwind setup that makes requests to the API.

## API Endpoints

- Register: `POST /register` with `{ "username": "your_username", "password": "your_password" }`
- Login: `POST /login` with `{ "username": "your_username", "password": "your_password" }`
- Clock In: `POST /clockin` with `x-user-id` header
- Clock Out: `POST /clockout` with `x-user-id` header
- View Timesheet: `GET /timesheet` with `x-user-id` header

Base URL when running locally: `http://localhost:3000`

## Frontend Usage

1. Open the frontend in your browser  
2. Register a new user  
3. Log in with that user  
4. Use the Clock In and Clock Out buttons  
5. View the timesheet to see entries  
6. Logout when done  

## Future Improvements

- Replace in-memory storage with MongoDB
- Use JWT for authentication
- Add input validation and better error handling
- Improve mobile design
- Add unit tests
- Possibly rebuild the frontend with React or Next.js

## Lessons Learned

- Keep the backend and frontend separated but connected cleanly
- Use simple deployments (Heroku + GitHub Pages) to focus on the code
- Even a small project benefits from organization and documentation
- Building out API endpoints and testing them early saves time

## Connect

Repo is available on GitHub. I’m open to feedback or collaboration.

I use GitHub Actions for demos and labs, not enterprise systems.

This post shows a small, honest CI setup and how I document what is planned.

You will get a working baseline, a checklist, and common mistakes.

## The promise

You will learn:

- a simple CI workflow
- how to keep claims accurate
- what to label as planned

> "If the workflow is not in the repo, it is not a claim."

## Baseline workflow

This is the minimal pattern I aim for in demo repos.

```yaml
name: ci
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run test --if-present
      - run: npm run build
```

## What is real vs planned

### Real today

- Lint and build in repos that include scripts.
- Manual deploys or simple deploy scripts.

### Planned

- Slack alerts
- Nightly audits
- Automated smoke checks

## CTA: Open the repo

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Add the baseline workflow.
2. Keep scripts simple.
3. Document any missing steps as planned.

### Common mistakes

- Claiming alerts you do not have.
- Listing checks that are not in CI.
- Copying YAML without testing it.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Workflow runs on push
- [ ] Lint and build pass
- [ ] Planned items listed clearly

## Next steps

- Add one smoke check.
- Add a small deploy step.
- Keep notes in the README.

CI does not need to be complicated to be useful.

This post shows a single workflow that runs build and lint.

You will add one workflow file and verify it in GitHub.

I cannot verify these steps from this blog repo. Treat this as a lab guide you can run locally.

## The promise

By the end, you will:

- add a workflow file to your repo
- run build and lint on every push
- verify the check appears in GitHub

> "If CI runs one real check, it is already worth it."

## What this is

**High level:** GitHub Actions runs scripts for you in the cloud when you push code.

**Low level:** You add a YAML file under `.github/workflows` and list the commands to run.

**Key terms:**

- **Workflow:** A YAML file that defines CI tasks.
- **Job:** A set of steps that run on a GitHub runner.
- **Step:** A command or action inside a job.

## What you need

- A GitHub repo
- A build and lint command in `package.json`

## Start to Finish

### Step 1: Add a workflow file
Goal:
Create a CI workflow that runs build and lint.

Actions:
- File path: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Add:
  ```yaml
  name: CI
  on:
    push:
      branches: ["main"]
    pull_request:
      branches: ["main"]

  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
          with:
            node-version: 18
        - run: npm install
        - run: npm run lint
        - run: npm run build
  ```

Why:
This workflow is the smallest useful CI setup. It installs dependencies and runs your real checks. It does not claim to do anything else. This keeps it honest and easy to maintain. You can expand later once this is stable.

Verify:
- Commit and push the file.
- In GitHub, open the Actions tab.
- Expected: a CI run appears and completes.
- This confirms the workflow is active.

If it fails:
- Symptom: workflow does not trigger.
- Fix: check the branch name and YAML indentation.

### Step 2: Verify build output locally
Goal:
Ensure the workflow commands pass on your machine.

Actions:
- Commands:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npm run build
  ```

Why:
CI should match local behavior. If you cannot run it locally, CI will fail. This step saves time by catching issues before push. It also confirms the scripts are correct.

Verify:
- Expected: both commands exit with code 0.
- This confirms CI should pass.

If it fails:
- Symptom: command not found.
- Fix: update the script names in the workflow.

## Verify it worked

- The Actions tab shows a green check.
- The workflow logs show both commands ran.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom:** CI fails on install.  
  **Cause:** Missing lockfile or incompatible Node version.  
  **Fix:** commit `package-lock.json` and match Node version.

- **Symptom:** CI passes but build is wrong.  
  **Cause:** You are not running the same build locally.  
  **Fix:** run the exact commands before push.

- **Symptom:** Workflow never triggers.  
  **Cause:** wrong branch name.  
  **Fix:** change `main` to your real default branch.

## Cheat sheet

- Put workflows in `.github/workflows`.
- Run `lint` and `build` only.
- Verify in the Actions tab.

## Next steps

- Add tests if you have them.
- Add a build artifact upload if needed.

## Final CTA

One clean workflow is enough to start. Make it real, then expand it later.

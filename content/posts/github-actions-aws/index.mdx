This is a demo-scale CI setup, not enterprise automation.

I use a small workflow to lint, test, and build demos. Anything beyond that is labeled as planned.

You will get the workflow, the checks, and the mistakes I avoid.

If you are setting up CI for a small project, this is for you.

## What this is

High level, CI runs checks on every push and pull request.

Low level, it is a YAML workflow in `.github/workflows/`.

Key terms:

- **Workflow**: the YAML file GitHub Actions runs.
- **Job**: a set of steps in a workflow.
- **Runner**: the machine that executes the steps.

## What you need

- A GitHub repo.
- A `package.json` with scripts.
- GitHub Actions enabled.

Docs used:

- https://docs.github.com/actions

## Start to finish

1) Create a workflow file.

Why: GitHub Actions only runs files in `.github/workflows/`.

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: ci
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run test --if-present
      - run: npm run build
```

2) Commit and push.

Why: The workflow will not run until it is in the repo.

3) Check the Actions tab.

Why: You need to confirm the workflow runs.

## Verify it worked

- The workflow shows as green in Actions.
- Lint, test, and build steps complete.
- Failed steps show a readable error log.

If it fails, fix the script locally and re-run.

## Common mistakes

- **Symptom**: Workflow does not run.
  **Cause**: File not in `.github/workflows/`.
  **Fix**: Move it and push.

- **Symptom**: npm ci fails.
  **Cause**: Missing lockfile.
  **Fix**: Commit `package-lock.json` or use `npm install`.

- **Symptom**: Tests not found.
  **Cause**: No test script.
  **Fix**: Use `--if-present` or add a script.

## Cheat sheet

- Put workflows in `.github/workflows/`.
- Use `npm ci` for clean installs.
- Check Actions after every push.

## Next steps

- Add a deploy step if you need it.
- Add a smoke check script.
- Keep planned items listed in README.

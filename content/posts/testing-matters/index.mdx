> **Context:** Early-career developer documenting the test strategy I actually run on my repos (Car-Match, CheeseMath, BasicServerSetup, AWS labs). No production on-call experience yet.  
> **AI assist:** ChatGPT helped me reorder notes; every tool listed below is in use today (or clearly labeled “pilot”).  
> **Status:** Snapshot, not perfection. Contract testing + accessibility automation still need work.

## Reality snapshot

- **Unit/component tests:** Jest/Vitest + Testing Library. Run locally (watch mode) and in CI on every PR.  
- **Integration tests:** Supertest + Dockerized Postgres/Mongo + LocalStack for AWS services. Run on PRs touching backend code.  
- **End-to-end:** Playwright smoke tests on Netlify deploy previews, Percy (pilot) for Gatsby visual diffs.  
- **Contract tests:** Pact/OpenAPI schema checks run manually before major refactors—automation coming soon.  
- **Observability:** Test runs push results to GitHub Checks + Slack notifications. Failures block merges.

## Pyramid breakdown

| Layer | Scope | Tools | Cadence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | Pure functions, hooks | Jest, Vitest | Watch + PR | ✅ |
| Component | React UI, accessibility | Testing Library, Storybook test runner | PR + nightly | ✅ |
| Integration | API + DB, AWS mocks | Supertest, LocalStack, Docker Compose | PRs touching backend | ✅ |
| Contract | API request/response contracts | Pact, OpenAPI validators | Manual before breaking changes | 🧪 Pilot |
| End-to-end | User flows | Playwright, Cypress (legacy), Percy (visual) | Main merges + scheduled | ✅ / 🧪 |

## Tooling details

- **Jest/Vitest:** Cover utility modules (date math, data transforms), React hooks, and components. Mocks replaced with MSW where possible.  
- **Testing Library:** Queries by role/label to ensure accessibility. If a component is hard to test, it’s usually poorly structured.  
- **Supertest + Docker Compose:** Spins up Express + Postgres containers, seeds data, runs API tests, tears everything down.  
- **LocalStack:** Emulates S3/DynamoDB/SNS for AWS labs. Lets me test IaC templates without hitting real AWS (saves $$).  
- **Playwright:** Automates login → CRUD → logout. Runs on Netlify deploy previews so I can review failures before shipping.  
- **Percy (pilot):** Visual snapshots for this Gatsby site. Still deciding if the cost is worth it.

## Reliability practices

- Each test suite uses isolated data (per-worker DB, temporary DynamoDB tables).  
- Factories generate deterministic fixtures to avoid flaky assertions.  
- Only end-to-end tests have retries (max 2) to handle occasional network hiccups.  
- Monthly “test hygiene” session: delete redundant tests, update snapshots, document new commands.

## Workflow

1. **Pre-commit:** Lint + unit tests via Husky.  
2. **Pull request:** Unit, component, integration suites run in GitHub Actions.  
3. **Deploy preview (Netlify/Render):** Playwright smoke suite + optional Percy run.  
4. **Main merge:** Deploy + regressions checks, nightly contract suite.  
5. **Weekly:** Manual contract tests (until automated) + accessibility spot checks.

## Known gaps

- Contract tests aren’t automated yet. I run them before schema changes, but a nightly job is on the roadmap.  
- Accessibility checks only run manually; I want axe in CI for components/pages.  
- Mobile end-to-end tests are limited—need to add Playwright mobile viewports.  
- Observability for Playwright runs is basic (GitHub logs). Would like better dashboards.

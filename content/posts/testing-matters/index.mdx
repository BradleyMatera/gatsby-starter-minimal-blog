I test to catch real bugs, not to impress anyone.

This post shows the test levels I actually run and what is still planned.

You will get the pyramid, a checklist, and the common mistakes.

## The promise

You will learn:

- what I test today
- what I do manually
- what is planned

> "A small test suite that runs beats a big suite that does not."

## What I do today

- Unit and component tests in repos that include them
- Manual smoke checks on key flows
- Short notes on test gaps

### Example test script

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run"
  }
}
```

## Now do it your way

### Steps

1. Add one unit test.
2. Add one smoke check.
3. Write one gap note.

### Common mistakes

- Writing tests that never run.
- Claiming CI gates without workflows.
- Skipping the README notes.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] One test runs
- [ ] One smoke check done
- [ ] Gaps listed

## Next steps

- Add one integration test.
- Add a small CI workflow if you have not.
